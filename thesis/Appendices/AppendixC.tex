The distance matrix $d_{ij}$ is one of the ingredient parameters of the FHN network model. It is used to quantify the time delays $\Delta t_{ij}$ between nodes $i$ and $j$, i.e. $\Delta t_{ij} = d_{ij} / v$, where $v$ is the signal propagation velocity along the axons \citep{VUK13, GHO08a}. The neuronal time-series of functionally and anatomically derived adjacency matrices is extracted  by using different $d_{ij}$ data. For the FCM, $d_{ij}$ is the matrix of Euclidean distances between centers of brain regions from which BOLD time series are extracted \citep{KAI06}. For the ACM, $d_{ij}$ is empirically provided with together with anatomical connectivity map \citep{ITU08}.
