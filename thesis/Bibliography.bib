We determine the conditions that must be satisfied by the time constants and phase dependence characterizing the coupling between the oscillators in order for the asynchronous state to be stable. We also consider the effects of noise. This work complements results on synchronous states in similar models and allows us to study the validity of firing-rate models commonly used for neural networks.},

  abstract = {We report measurements on the synchronization properties of organ pipes. First, we investigate influence of an external acoustical signal from a loudspeaker on the sound of an organ pipe. Second, the mutual influence of two pipes with different pitch is analyzed. In analogy to the externally driven, or mutually coupled self-sustained oscillators, one observes a frequency locking, which can be explained by synchronization theory. Further, we measure the dependence of the frequency of the signals emitted by two mutually detuned pipes with varying distance between the pipes. The spectrum shows a broad "hump" structure, not found for coupled oscillators. This indicates a complex coupling of the two organ pipes leading to nonlinear beat phenomena.},

For systems with very strong nonlinearities in the local dynamics, however, the transition is found to be in the universality class of directed percolation.},

The injected signal consists of an optical comb with harmonics 35 GHz apart and a bandwidth of approximately 1.9 THz. The optical comb is a result of strong four-wave mixing in a highly-nonlinear dispersion-shifted fiber. In order to observe locking of the multi-section laser, the output is optically downconverted to RF frequencies using the same optical comb. The locked multi-section DFB laser is a coherent and tunable optical source suitable for continuous-wave terahertz generation systems. },

A common aspect of such systems is the presence of feedback that couples the output signal partially back to the input. Feedback coupling can be well controlled in optoelectronic devices such as conventional semiconductor lasers that provide bench-top platforms for the study of chaotic behaviour and high bit rate random number generation. Here we experimentally demonstrate that chaos can be observed for quantum-dot microlasers operating close to the quantum limit at nW output powers. Applying self-feedback to a quantum-dot microlaser results in a dramatic change in the photon statistics wherein strong, super-thermal photon bunching is indicative of random-intensity fluctuations associated with the spiked emission of light. Our experiments reveal that gain competition of few quantum dots in the active layer enhances the influence of self-feedback and will open up new avenues for the study of chaos in quantum systems.}},

  abstract = {A simple effective medium theory is derived for spatially heterogeneous reaction-diffusion media.
 
Its validity is tested through comparisons with simulations of front and pulse propagation in systems
 
with spatially varying diffusion coefficients and reaction rates. The theory is able to predict wave
 
speeds if the characteristic front width is much larger than the length scale of the heterogeneities.
 
This condition is violated in media with isolated or weakly connected sites. In such media the
 
theory nevertheless provides good results if it predicts the percolation threshold of the involved sites
 
correctly.},

It is found that additive white noise can induce phase slips in integer multiples of 2&#960;&#8217;s in parameter regimes where phase synchronization is observed in the absence of noise. The average time duration of the temporal phase synchronization scales with the noise amplitude in a way that can be described as superpersistent transient. We give two independent heuristic derivations that yield the same numerically observed scaling law.},

Four different device concepts are studied in detail: Schottky-barrier NW-FETs with metallic source and drain contacts, conventional-type NW-FETs with doped NW segments as source and drain electrodes, and, finally, two new concepts that enable steep turn-on characteristics, namely, NW impact ionization FETs and tunnel NW-FETs. As it turns out, NW-FETs are, to a large extent, determined by the device geometry, the dimensionality of the electronic transport, and the way of making contacts to the NW. Analytical as well as simulation results are compared with experimental data to explain the various factors impacting the electronic transport in NW-FETs.}},

  abstract = {Novel methods for information processing are highly desired in our information-driven society. Inspired by the brain's ability to process information, the recently introduce d paradigm known as 'reservoir computing' shows that complex networks can efficiently perform computation. Here we introduce a novel architecture that reduces the usually required large number of elements to a single nonlinear node with delayed feedback. Through an electronic implementation, we experimentally and numerically demonstrate excellent performance in a spee ch recognition benchmark. Complementary numerical studies also show excellent performance for a time series prediction benchmark. These results prove that delay-dynamical systems, even in their simplest manifestation, can perform efficient information processing. This finding paves the way to feasible and resource-efficient technological implementations of reservoir c omputing.},

  abstract = {The modular structure is pervasive in many complex networks of interactions observed in natural, social and technological sciences. Its study sheds light on the relation between the structure and the function of complex systems. Generally speaking, modules are islands of highly connected nodes separated by a relatively small number of links. Every module can have the contributions of links from any node in the network. The challenge is to disentangle these contributions to understand how the modular structure is built. The main problem is that the analysis of a certain partition into modules involves, in principle, as much data as the number of modules times the number of nodes. To confront this challenge, here we first define the contribution matrix, the mathematical object containing all the information about the partition of interest, and then we use truncated singular value decomposition to extract the best representation of this matrix in a plane. The analysis of this projection allows us to scrutinize the skeleton of the modular structure, revealing the structure of individual modules and their interrelations.},

properties of lasing from the two different initial states. The larger differential gain of the excited

compression results in largely improved modulation capabilities. We demonstrate maximum

  abstract = {We consider unstable attractors; Milnor attractors $A$ such that, for some neighbourhood $U$ of $A$, almost all initial conditions leave $U$. Previous research strongly suggests that unstable attractors exist and even occur robustly (i.e. for open sets of parameter values) in a system modelling biological phenomena, namely in globally coupled oscillators with delayed pulse interactions.
 
In the first part of this paper we give a rigorous definition of unstable attractors for general dynamical systems. We classify unstable attractors into two types, depending on whether or not there is a neighbourhood of the attractor that intersects the basin in a set of positive measure. We give examples of both types of unstable attractor; these examples have non-invertible dynamics that collapse certain open sets onto stable manifolds of saddle orbits.
 
In the second part we give the first rigorous demonstration of existence and robust occurrence of unstable attractors in a network of oscillators with delayed pulse coupling. Although such systems are technically hybrid systems of delay differential equations with discontinuous `firing' events, we show that their dynamics reduces to a finite dimensional hybrid system system after a finite time and hence we can discuss Milnor attractors for this reduced finite dimensional system. We prove that for an open set of phase resetting functions there are saddle periodic orbits that are unstable attractors.},

This model has been found to exhibit robust &#8216;slow switching&#8217; oscillations that are caused by the presence of robust heteroclinic attractors. This paper presents a bifurcation analysis of the system in an attempt to better understand the creation of such attractors. We consider bifurcations that occur in a system of identical oscillators on varying the parameters in the coupling function. These bifurcations preserve the permutation symmetry of the system. We then investigate the implications of these bifurcations for the sensitivity to detuning (i.e. the size of the smallest perturbations that give rise to loss of frequency locking).
 

 
For N=3 we find three types of heteroclinic bifurcation that are codimension-one with symmetry. On varying two parameters in the coupling function we find three curves giving (a) an S3-transcritical homoclinic bifurcation, (b) a saddle&#8211;node/heteroclinic bifurcation and (c) a View the MathML source-heteroclinic bifurcation. We also identify several global bifurcations with symmetry that organize the bifurcation diagram; these are codimension-two with symmetry.
 

 
For N=4 oscillators we determine many (but not all) codimension-one bifurcations with symmetry, including those that lead to a robust heteroclinic cycle. A robust heteroclinic cycle is stable in an open region of parameter space and unstable in another open region. Furthermore, we verify that there is a subregion where the heteroclinic cycle is the only attractor of the system, while for other parts of the phase plane it can coexist with stable limit cycles. We finish with a discussion of bifurcations that appear for this coupling function and general N, as well as for more general coupling functions.},

  abstract = {Synchronization between two coupled complex networks with fractional-order dynamics, hereafter referred to as outer synchronization, is investigated in this work. In particular, we consider two systems consisting of interconnected nodes. The state variables of each node evolve with time according to a set of (possibly nonlinear and chaotic) fractional-order differential equations. One of the networks plays the role of a master system and drives the second network by way of an open-plus-closed-loop (OPCL) scheme. Starting from a simple analysis of the synchronization error and a basic lemma on the eigenvalues of matrices resulting from Kronecker products, we establish various sets of conditions for outer synchronization, i.e., for ensuring that the errors between the state variables of the master and response systems can asymptotically vanish with time. Then, we address the problem of robust outer synchronization, i.e., how to guarantee that the states of the nodes converge to common values when the parameters of the master and response networks are not identical, but present some perturbations. Assuming that these perturbations are bounded, we also find conditions for outer synchronization, this time given in terms of sets of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Most of the analytical results in this paper are valid both for fractional-order and integer-order dynamics. The assumptions on the inner (coupling) structure of the networks are mild, involving, at most, symmetry and diffusivity. The analytical results are complemented with numerical examples. In particular, we show examples of generalized and robust outer synchronization for networks whose nodes are governed by fractional-order Lorenz dynamics.},

Using this definition we show that chimera states cannot appear in globally coupled phase oscillators or for networks of indistinguishable oscillators that are too small. On the other hand they can exist for networks of at least four indistinguishable oscillators, and we investigate some small networks of four, six and ten indistinguishable oscillators where one can prove that such attracting chimera states exist and are robustly stable. We give some sufficient conditions for existence of attracting chimera states in more general modular networks and examine the role of special coupling (Kuramoto-Sakaguchi) in giving degenerate (neutrally stable) families of chimera states that become lose their degeneracy on including a higher order harmonic in the coupling. },

We focus on information transmission delays, as opposed to information processing delays, so that each node of the network compares its current state with the past states of its neighbours. We consider directed and weighted networks where the connection structure is described by a normalized Laplacian matrix and show that consensus is achieved if and only if the underlying graph contains a directed spanning tree. This statement holds independently of the transmission delays, which is in contrast to the case of processing delays. Furthermore, we calculate the consensus value explicitly, and show that it is determined by the history of the system over an interval of time, unlike the case of processing delays where the consensus value depends only on the initial state of the system at time zero. This provides the consensus algorithm with improved robustness against noise. },

  abstract = {Neural mass signals from in-vivo recordings often show oscillations with frequencies ranging from <1 Hz to 100 Hz. Fast rhythmic activity in the beta and gamma range can be generated by network based mechanisms such as recurrent synaptic excitation-inhibition loops. Slower oscillations might instead depend on neuronal adaptation currents whose timescales range from tens of milliseconds to seconds. Here we investigate how the dynamics of such adaptation currents contribute to spike rate oscillations and resonance properties in recurrent networks of excitatory and inhibitory neurons. Based on a network of sparsely coupled spiking model neurons with two types of adaptation current and conductance based synapses with heterogeneous strengths and delays we use a mean-field approach to analyze oscillatory network activity. For constant external input, we find that spike-triggered adaptation currents provide a mechanism to generate slow oscillations over a wide range of adaptation timescales as long as recurrent synaptic excitation is sufficiently strong. Faster rhythms occur when recurrent inhibition is slower than excitation and oscillation frequency increases with the strength of inhibition. Adaptation facilitates such network based oscillations for fast synaptic inhibition and leads to decreased frequencies. For oscillatory external input, adaptation currents amplify a narrow band of frequencies and cause phase advances for low frequencies in addition to phase delays at higher frequencies. Our results therefore identify the different key roles of neuronal adaptation dynamics for rhythmogenesis and selective signal propagation in recurrent networks.},

  abstract = {The application of femtosecond spectroscopy to the study of ultrafast dynamics in semiconductor materials and nanostructures is reviewed with particular emphasis on the physics that can be learned fro m it. Excitation with ultrashort optical pulses in general results in the creation of coherent superpositions and correlated many-particle states. The review comprises a discussion of the dynamics of this correla ted many-body system during and after pulsed excitation as well as its analysis by means of refined measurements and advanced theories. After an introduction of basic concepts--such as coherence, correlation and quantum kinetics--a brief overview of the most important experimental techniques and theoretical approaches is given. The remainder of this paper is devoted to specific results selected in order to highlight how femtosecond spectroscopy gives access to the physics of coherences, correlations and quantum kinetics involving charge, spin and lattice degrees of freedom.First examples deal with the dynamics of basic laser-ind uced coherences that can be observed, e.g. in quantum beat spectroscopy, in coherent control measurements or in experiments using few-cycle pulses. The phenomena discussed here are basic in the sense that they ca n be understood to a large extent on the mean-field level of the theory. Nevertheless, already on this level it is found that semiconductors behave substantially differently from atomic systems. Subsequent sectio ns report on the occurrence of coherences and correlations beyond the mean-field level that are mediated either by carrier-phonon or carrier-carrier interactions. The corresponding analysis gives deep insight int o fundamental issues such as the energy-time uncertainty, pure dephasing in quantum dot structures, the role of two-pair or even higher correlations and the build-up of screening. Finally results are presented co ncerning the ultrafast dynamics of resonantly coupled excitations, where a combination of different interaction mechanisms is involved in forming new types of correlations. Examples are coupled plasmon-phonon and Bloch-phonon oscillations.The results reviewed in this paper clearly reveal the central role of many-particle correlations and coherences for the ultrafast dynamics of dense semiconductor systems. Both the prese nce of strong correlation effects and the formation of coherences in a genuine many-particle system have important implications for the controllability of optical signals from this class of materials, which is of utmost importance for applications in present-day and future optoelectronic devices.},

We show that the observed synchronization transition, on changing the strength of the stochastic coupling between replicas, belongs to the directed percolation universality class. This result is consistent with the behavior of chaotic deterministic cellular automata (DCA), supporting the equivalence ansatz between SC models and DCA. The coupling threshold above which the two system replicas synchronize is strictly related to the propagation velocity of perturbations in the system.},

These patterns however are often dominated by specific locations and recurrent flows and poorly modelled by the random diffusive dynamics generally used to study them. Here we develop a theoretical framework to analyse contagion within a network of locations where individuals recall their geographic origins. We find a phase transition between a regime in which the contagion affects a large fraction of the system and one in which only a small fraction is affected. This transition cannot be uncovered by continuous deterministic models because of the stochastic features of the contagion process and defines an invasion threshold that depends on mobility parameters, providing guidance for controlling contagion spread by constraining mobility processes.We recover the threshold behaviour by analysing diffusion processes mediated by real human commuting data.},

The model includes an evolution equation for the material polarization in semiconductor media obtained from the calculation of the electrical susceptibility. A new parameter &#945;0 appears which accounts for the asymmetry of the spectral gain curve and the non-zero dispersion at the gain peak, and it also induces a shift of the frequency of the gain peak as the carrier density is varied. The model seems flexible enough to describe a variety of experimental results.

  abstract = {Spatially extended dynamical systems, namely coupled map lattices, driven by additive spatio-temporal noise are shown to exhibit stochastic synchronization. In analogy with low-dimensional systems, synchronization can be achieved only if the maximum Lyapunov exponent becomes negative for sufficiently large noise amplitude. Moreover, noise can suppress also the nonlinear mechanism of information propagation, which may be present in the spatially extended system. An example of phase transition is observed when both the linear and the nonlinear mechanisms of information production disappear at the same critical value of the noise amplitude. The corresponding critical properties cannot be estimated numerically with great accuracy, but some general argument suggests that they could be ascribed to the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class. Conversely, when the nonlinear mechanism prevails on the linear one, another type of phase transition to stochastic synchronization occurs. This one is shown to belong to the universality class of directed percolation.},

  abstract = {Networked structures arise in a wide array of different contexts such as technological and transportation infrastructures, social phenomena, and biological systems. These highly interconnected systems have recently been the focus of a great deal of attention that has uncovered and characterized their topological complexity. Along with a complex topological structure, real networks display a large heterogeneity in the capacity and intensity of the connections. These features, however, have mainly not been considered in past studies where links are usually represented as binary states, i.e., either present or absent. Here, we study the scientific collaboration network and the world-wide air-transportation network, which are representative examples of social and large infrastructure systems, respectively. In both cases it is possible to assign to each edge of the graph a weight proportional to the intensity or capacity of the connections among the various elements of the network. We define appropriate metrics combining weighted and topological observables that enable us to characterize the complex statistical properties and heterogeneity of the actual strength of edges and vertices. This information allows us to investigate the correlations among weighted quantities and the underlying topological structure of the network. These results provide a better description of the hierarchies and organizational principles at the basis of the architecture of weighted networks.},

  abstract = {Many complex networks have a small-world topology characterized by dense local clustering or cliquishness
 
of connections between neighboring nodes yet a short path length between any (distant) pair of nodes due to
 
the existence of relatively few long-range connections. This is an attractive model for the organization of brain
 
anatomical and functional networks because a small-world topology can support both segregated/specialized
 
and distributed/integrated information processing. Moreover, small-world networks are economical, tending to
 
minimize wiring costs while supporting high dynamical complexity. The authors introduce some of the key
 
mathematical concepts in graph theory required for small-world analysis and review how these methods have
 
been applied to quantification of cortical connectivity matrices derived from anatomical tract-tracing studies
 
in the macaque monkey and the cat. The evolution of small-world networks is discussed in terms of a selection
 
pressure to deliver cost-effective information-processing systems. The authors illustrate how these techniques
 
and concepts are increasingly being applied to the analysis of human brain functional networks derived
 
from electroencephalography/magnetoencephalography and fMRI experiments. Finally, the authors consider
 
the relevance of small-world models for understanding the emergence of complex behaviors and the resilience
 
of brain systems to pathological attack by disease or aberrant development. They conclude that small-world
 
models provide a powerful and versatile approach to understanding the structure and function of human brain
 
systems.},

  abstract = {Networks of living neurons exhibit diverse patterns of activity, including oscillations, synchrony, and waves. Recent work in physics has shown yet another mode of activity in systems composed of many nonlinear units interacting locally. For example, avalanches, earthquakes, and forest fires all propagate in systems organized into a critical state in which event sizes show no characteristic scale and are described by power laws. We hypothesized that a similar mode of activity with complex emergent properties could exist in networks of cortical neurons. We investigated this issue in mature organotypic cultures and acute slices of rat cortex by recording spontaneous local field potentials continuously using a 60 channel multielectrode array. Here, we show that propagation of spontaneous activity in cortical networks is described by equations that govern avalanches. As predicted by theory for a critical branching process, the propagation obeys a power law with an exponent of -3/2 for event sizes, with a branching parameter close to the critical value of 1. Simulations show that a branching parameter at this value optimizes information transmission in feedforward networks, while preventing runaway network excitation. Our findings suggest that &#8220;neuronal avalanches&#8221; may be a generic property of cortical networks, and represent a mode of activity that differs profoundly from oscillatory, synchronized, or wave-like network states. In the critical state, the network may satisfy the competing demands of information transmission and network stability.},

  abstract = {We study the influence of coupling strength and network topology on synchronization behavior in pulse-coupled networks of bursting Hindmarsh-Rose neurons. Surprisingly, we find that the stability of the completely synchronous state in such networks only depends on the number of signals each neuron receives, independent of all other details of the network topology. This is in contrast with linearly coupled bursting neurons where complete synchrony strongly depends on the network structure and number of cells. Through analysis and numerics, we show that the onset of synchrony in a network with any coupling topology admitting complete synchronization is ensured by one single condition.},

Photon cross-correlation measurements between biexciton and exciton decay reveal a bunching effect under pulsed excitation due to the cascaded nature of the emission. No polarization correlation between the exciton and biexciton emission is observed. Furthermore, the emission mode structure of the pillar microcavities is investigated within a theory-experiment comparison where calculations are based on an extended transfer matrix method. Efficient mode confinement perpendicular to the emission direction leads to a series of transverse modes combined with enhanced QD emission. For the photoluminescence (PL) intensity of QDs in pillar microcavities (0.6 mm diameter), an enhancement factor of 40 was found in comparison to the PL intensity of QDs in bulk semiconductors, reflecting the enhanced photon collection effect out of the cavity structure.},

  abstract = {Quantum dot (QD)-based semiconductor optical amplifiers offer unique properties compared with conventional devices based on bulk or quantum well material. Due to the bandfilling properties of QDs and the existence of a nearby reservoir of carriers in the form of a wetting layer, QD semiconductor optical amplifiers may be operated in regimes of high linearity, i.e. with a high saturation power, but can also show strong and fast nonlinearities by breaking the equilibrium between discrete dot states and the continuum of wetting layer states. In this paper, we analyse the interplay of these two carrier populations in terms of a simple rate equation model. Based on the steady-state and small-signal properties of the model, we analyse and discuss the optical modulation response and the four-wave mixing properties of QD semiconductor optical amplifiers, in particular emphasizing the role of ultrafast gain dynamics.},

It is shown to outperform all other known community detection methods in terms of computation time. Moreover, the quality of the communities detected is very good, as measured by the so-called modularity. This is shown first by identifying language communities in a Belgian mobile phone network of 2 million customers and by analysing a web graph of 118 million nodes and more than one billion links. The accuracy of our algorithm is also verified on ad hoc modular networks.},

Stability of the controlled system is addressed by studying an eigenvalue spectrum of a corresponding characteristic equation with two time delays. Analytic expression for the stabilizing control strength is derived in terms of original system parameters and the time delay of the control. Theoretical and numerical computations show that an interplay between the
 
control strength and two time delays provides a number of regions in the parameter space where the time-delayed feedback control can successfully stabilize an otherwise unstable steady state.},

We show that in the case of a vanishing decay rate for the long-lasting immune response, the system exhibits the so-called &#8220;bifurcations without parameters&#8221; due to the existence of a hypersurface of equilibria in the phase space. When the decay rate of the long-lasting immune response is different from zero, the hypersurface of equilibria degenerates, and a multitude of other steady states are born, many of which are related by a permutation symmetry of the system. The robustness of the fully symmetric state of the system was investigated by means of numerical computation of transverse Lyapunov exponents. The results of this exercise indicate that for a vanishing decay of long-lasting immune response, the fully symmetric state is not robust in the substantial part of the parameter space, and instead all variants develop their own temporal dynamics contributing to the overall time evolution. At the same time, if the decay rate of the long-lasting immune response is increased, the fully symmetric state can become robust provided the growth rate of the long-lasting immune response is rapid.},

  abstract = {Coupled biological and chemical systems, neural networks, social interacting species, the Internet and the World Wide Web, are only a few examples of systems composed by a large number of highly interconnected dynamical units. The first approach to capture the global properties of such systems is to model them as graphs whose nodes represent the dynamical units, and whose links stand for the interactions between them. On the one hand, scientists have to cope with structural issues, such as characterizing the topology of a complex wiring architecture, revealing the unifying principles that are at the basis of real networks, and developing models to mimic the growth of a network and reproduce its structural properties. On the other hand, many relevant questions arise when studying complex networks' dynamics, such as learning how a large ensemble of dynamical systems that interact through a complex wiring topology can behave collectively. We review the major concepts and results recently achieved in the study of the structure and dynamics of complex networks, and summarize the relevant applications of these ideas in many different disciplines, ranging from nonlinear science to biology, from statistical mechanics to medicine and engineering.},

Using center manifold reduction and the normal form method, we reduce the equation governing the dynamics of the whole network to an amplitude-phase model (i.e.a set of coupled ordinary differential equations describing the evolution of both the amplitudes and the phases of the oscillators). Then we prove the existence of traveling waves, in-phase and anti-phase locked oscillations, in both one-dimensional and two-dimensional lattices. The influence of the interaction strength and the number of oscillators is investigated, and the possible coexistence of waves and phase locked oscillations is shown.},

It is demonstrated that the transition from trigger waves to phase waves is preceded by qualitative changes in the dispersion relation of the former. These changes in dispersion in turn are provided by modified decay properties behind a solitary pulse. At high values of excitability the dispersion curve of trigger waves is destroyed upon a transcritical collision with the dispersion curve of phase waves, so both types of waves turn out to be connected in the small-wavelength region. As an important part of the study we present the results on the linear stability analysis of the waves close to the transition threshold. In particular, the stability of trigger waves with wiggly dispersion is thoroughly scrutinized and the stability of phase waves close to the transcritical collision is analyzed as well. We accompany our studies with one-dimensional simulations of the transition between phase and trigger waves under variation of the control parameter.},

Utilizing the established continuation engine AUTO, our method is simple in implementation and can be easily modified to suit a particular reaction-diffusion system. Since the method does not involve direct simulations of the reaction-diffusion system, unstable branches of rigidly rotating spiral waves can be computed as well. We illustrate our method by computing single- and multi-armed spirals in the Barkley model. Continuation of single-armed spirals displays nearly identical results with the Barkley's continuation code STEADY. The dependence of spiral waves on the geometry of the medium reproduces the results of numerical simulations reported before in[A.M. Pertsov, E.A. Ermakova, A.V. Panfilov, Rotating spiral waves in a modified Fitz-Hugh-Nagumo model, Physica D 14 (1) (1984) 117-124], revealing, however, some subtle details like non-monotonous dependence of the rotation frequency on the disc radius and the existence of an unstable rotating solution that separates coexisting free and pinned spirals. We demonstrate that on bounded discs, spiral waves are accompanied by boundary spots -- slowly rotating solutions which are localized near the outer boundary of the disc. Boundary spots are shown to be closely related to one- and two-dimensional unstable critical solutions, such as unstable pulses in one dimension and critical fingers in two dimensions, which separate spiral waves from shrinking wave segments.},

  abstract = {We consider the effect of asymmetric temporal delays in a system of two coupled Hopfield neurons. For couplings of opposite signs, a limit cycle emerges via a supercritical Hopf bifurcation when the sum of the delays reaches a critical value. We show that the angular frequency of the limit cycle is independent of an asymmetry in the delays. However, the delay asymmetry determines the phase difference between the periodic activities of the two components. Specifically, when the connection with negative coupling has a delay much larger than the delay for the positive coupling, the system approaches in-phase synchrony between the two components. Employing variational perturbation theory (VPT), we achieve an approximate analytical evaluation of the phase shift, in good agreement with numerical results.},

  abstract = {In this paper networks that optimize a combined measure of local and global synchronizability are evolved. It is shown that for low coupling improvements in the local synchronizability dominate network evolution. This leads to an expressed grouping of elements with similar native frequency into cliques, allowing for an early onset of synchronization, but rendering full synchronization hard to achieve. In contrast, for large coupling the network evolution is governed by improvements towards full synchronization, preventing any expressed community structure. Such networks exhibit strong coupling between dissimilar oscillators. Albeit a rapid transition to full synchronization is achieved, the onset of synchronization is delayed in comparison to the first type of networks. The paper illustrates that an early onset of synchronization (which relates to clustering) and global synchronization are conflicting demands on network topology.},

Analyzing the evolved arrangement of nodes in space and their corresponding network topology, a class of small-world networks characterized by spatial and network modularity is found. More precisely, for low cost of wire optimal configurations are characterized by a division of nodes into two spatial groups with maximum distance from each other, whereas network modularity is low. For high cost of wire, the nodes organize into several distinct groups in space that correspond to network modules connected on a ring. In between, spatially and relationally modular small-world networks are found.},

We relate the superior PFSs to a strongly skewed out-degree distribution, the density of double links and a hierarchical periphery-core organization. Ensembles (i) and (ii) are found to differ in the density of double links and the particular organization of the core and the periphery-core linkage.},

  abstract = {{This paper demonstrates an analytical expression for the quasistatic capacitance of a quantum dot layer embedded in a junction, where the reverse bias is used to discharge the initially occupied energy levels. This analysis can be used to determine the position and the Gaussian homogeneous broadening of the energy levels in the conduction band, and is applied for an InGaAs/GaAs quantum dot structure grown by metal organic chemical vapor deposition. It is shown that the Gaussian broadening of the conduction band levels is significantly larger than the broadening of the interband photoluminescence (PL) transitions involving both conduction and hole states. The analysis also reveals a contribution from the wetting layer both in PL and modeled C-V profiles which is much stronger than in typical molecular beam epitaxy grown dots. The presence of a built-in local field oriented from the apex of the dot toward its base, contrary to the direction expected for a strained dot with uniform composition (negative dipole), is also derived from fitting of the C- V experimental data.

The lasers, which have stable output intensity when isolated, behave chaotically when coupled unidirectionally in a closed chain. In this way, we show that neither feedback nor bidirectional coupling is necessary to induce chaotic dynamics at the laser output. We study the synchronization phenomena arising in this particular coupling architecture and discuss its possible application to chaos-based communications. Next, we extend the study to bidirectional coupling and propose an appropriate technique to optical chaos encryption/decryption in closed chains of mutually coupled semiconductor lasers.},

This implies that both networks have the same degree distribution P(k). We call such networks correspondently coupled networks (CCNs). We assume that the nodes in each network are randomly connected. We define the mutually connected clusters and the mutual giant component as in earlier works on randomly coupled interdependent networks and assume that only the nodes that belong to the mutual giant component remain functional.We assume that initially a 1 &#8722; p fraction of nodes are randomly removed because of an attack or failure and find analytically, for an arbitrary P(k), the fraction of nodes &#956;(p) that belong to the mutual giant component. We find that the system undergoes a percolation transition at a certain fraction p = pc, which is always smaller than pc for randomly coupled networks with the same P(k). We also find that the system undergoes a first-order transition at pc > 0 if P(k) has a finite second moment. For the case of scale-free networks with 2  0. Finally, we find that the robustness of CCN increases with the broadness of their degree distribution.},

or connectomes also have high topological efficiency, robustness, modularity and a {\^a}��rich
 
club{\^a}�� of connector hubs. Many of these and other advantageous topological properties will
 
probably entail a wiring-cost premium. We propose that brain organization is shaped by an
 
economic trade-off between minimizing costs and allowing the emergence of adaptively
 
valuable topological patterns of anatomical or functional connectivity between multiple
 
neuronal populations. This process of negotiating, and re-negotiating, trade-offs between
 
wiring cost and topological value continues over long (decades) and short (millisecond)
 
timescales as brain networks evolve, grow and adapt to changing cognitive demands. An
 
economical analysis of neuropsychiatric disorders highlights the vulnerability of the more
 
costly elements of brain networks to pathological attack or abnormal development.},

Bifurcations of equilibria in an N=2 case are studied analytically, and it is then numerically confirmed that the same bifurcations are relevant for the dynamics in the case N>2. Bifurcations found include inverse and direct Hopf and fold limit cycle bifurcations. Typical dynamics for different small time lags and coupling intensities could be excitable with a single globally stable equilibrium, asymptotic oscillatory with symmetric limit cycle, bistable with stable equilibrium and a symmetric limit cycle, and again coherent oscillatory but nonsymmetric and phase shifted. For an intermediate range of time lags, inverse sub-critical Hopf and fold limit cycle bifurcations lead to the phenomenon of oscillator death. The phenomenon does not occur in the case of FitzHugh-Nagumo oscillators with the same type of coupling.},

  abstract = {Facebook is becoming a pervasive entity as its social, cultural and media ramifications grow deep and entrenched in our daily life. Its nature of a complex system of interactions, bearing a strong similarity to networks built through individual choices and systems shaped by evolutionary pressure, makes it an interesting target for research. Scale-free Small World networks, recently popularized by Barabasi, are a topological class pertaining to both these domains, whose members have resilience to disruption and short intermediate connections between nodes. In this paper we show that the topological structure of a specific subset of Facebook, gathered using data from a self-report online questionnaire on its usage, is similar but measurably different from a scale-free Small World network. We conjecture that the reason for this counterintuitive result lies in the dynamics behind friendship requests. This concept may be extendable to the whole network and to other social networks, and is useful to understand Facebook strengths and weaknesses, and to forecast its evolution.},

the interaction. By comparing the measurements to a numerical simulation, we are able to decipher the time
 
evolution of effective two-state Schr

odinger wave functions representing the ensembles of electronic states along
 
the propagation path. The imprinted signatures on the pulse phase and amplitude stem from the accumulated

to the effective ensemble states is shown to result from the response of the refractive index.},

Within a suitably chosen range of parameter values this reduced description yields anomalous SR gains exceeding unity and, simultaneously, gives rise to a nonmonotonic behavior of the SNR vs the noise strength. The analytical results agree well with those obtained from numerical solutions of the Langevin equation.},

We present an approach to the stochastic counting process of noise-induced switching events: starting from the Markovian dynamics of the nonstationary, continuous particle dynamics, one finds upon contraction onto two states a non-Markovian renewal dynamics. A proper definition of an output discrete phase is given, and the time rate of change of its noise average determines the corresponding output frequency. The phenomenon of noise-assisted phase synchronization is investigated in terms of an effective, instantaneous phase diffusion. The theory is applied to rectangular-shaped rocking signals versus increasing input-noise strengths. In this case, for an appropriate choice of the parameter values, the system exhibits a noise-induced frequency locking accompanied by a very pronounced suppression of the phase diffusion of the output signal. Precise numerical simulations corroborate very favorably our analytical results. The novel theoretical findings are also compared with prior ones.},

  abstract = {Some biological regulatory systems must "remember" a state for long periods of time. A simple type of system that can accomplish this task is one in which two regulatory elements negatively regulate one another. For example, two repressor proteins might control one another's synthesis. Qualitative reasoning suggests that such a system will have two stable states, one in which the first element is "on" and the second "off", and another in which these states are reversed. Quantitative analysis shows that the existence of two stable steady states depends on the details of the system. Among other things, the shapes of functions describing the e!ect of one regulatory element on the other must meet certain criteria in order for two steady states to exist. Many biologically reasonable functions do not meet these criteria. In particular, repression that is well described by a Michaelis-Menten-type equation cannot lead to a working switch. However, functions describing positive cooperativity of binding, non- additive e!ects of multiple operator sites, or depletion of free repressor can lead to working switches.},

Stability analysis of the dynamics of Hindmarsh-Rose and foodweb networks shows that controlling this dynamical flow can greatly enhance the synchronization and generate both chaotic and regular synchronous states for whatever state of an isolated node. Our results provide a possibility for the control of synchronization in complex networks by the manipulation of the dynamical flow.},

  abstract = {In mammalian visual cortex, neurons are organized according to their
 
functional properties into multiple maps such as retinotopic, ocular dominance, orientation
 
preference, direction of motion, and others. What determines the organization of
 
cortical maps? We argue that cortical maps reflect neuronal connectivity in intracortical
 
circuits. Because connecting distant neurons requires costly wiring (i.e., axons and
 
dendrites), there is an evolutionary pressure to place connected neurons as close to each
 
other as possible. Then, cortical maps may be viewed as solutions that minimize wiring
 
cost for given intracortical connectivity. These solutions can help us in inferring intracortical
 
connectivity and, ultimately, in understanding the function of the visual system.},

We consider two delay-coupled normal forms for Hopf bifurcation and demonstrate the conversion of stability, i.e., an interchange between the sub- and supercritical Hopf bifurcation. The control system provides us with an unified method for stabilizing both the unstable periodic orbit and the unstable steady state and reveals typical effects like amplitude death and phase locking. The main method and the results are applicable to a wide class of systems showing Hopf bifurcations, for example, the Van der Pol oscillator. The analytical theory is supported by numerical simulations of two delay-coupled Van der Pol oscillators, which show good agreement with the theory.},

QMMIC consists of a heterojunction interband tunneling diode and a high electron-mobility transistor monolithically integrated to obtain a new functional device. This technology enables the realization of low-voltage, high-density, and high-functionality circuits. A detailed description of the design and analysis techniques for several circuits such as an amplifier, an oscillator, and a mixer, along with the analytical treatment of the principle of operation are given in this paper. A number of prototypes implemented in InP technology constitute the proof-of-concept of the unique features of QNMIC circuit blocks for low-power wireless systems.}},

  abstract = {This paper reviews our recent work on the synchronization of excitable systems in a master-slave configuration and when the slave system includes a delayed self-coupling term. Particularly, we address the existence of the so-called anticipated synchronization, i.e. a dynamical regime in which the slave system is able to reproduce in advance the evolution of the master. This is most remarkable since the anticipated synchronization appears even when the excitable spikes are induced by random terms, such as white noise. After providing a short review of the general theory of synchronization as well as the main features of excitable systems, we present numerical and experimental results in coupled excitable systems of the FitzHugh-Nagumo type driven by different types of noise. The experiments have been done in electronic implementations of the model equations. We present the conditions (values of the coupling intensity and delay time) for which the anticipated synchronization regime is a stable one and show that it is possible to increase the anticipation time by using a cascade of several coupled systems. We use a particular limit of the FitzHugh-Nagumo system, as well as a simple excitable model, to give evidence that the physical reason for the existence of anticipated synchronization is the lowering of the excitability threshold of the slave due to the coupling. Finally, we propose a hypothesis for a possible explanation of the zero-lag synchronization observed in some real neuron systems.},

  abstract = {We study how a coupled array of spiking chaotic systems synchronizes to an external driving in a short time. Synchronization means spike separation at adjacent sites much shorter than the average inter-spike interval; a local lack of synchronization is called a defect. The system displays sudden spontaneous defect disappearance at a critical coupling strength. Below critical coupling, the system reaches order at a definite amplitude of an external input; this order persists for a fixed time slot. Thus, the array behaves as an excitable system, even though the single element lacks such a property. The above features provide a dynamical explanation of feature binding in perceptual tasks.},

  abstract = {Stabilization of instable periodic orbits of nonlinear dynamical systems has been a widely explored field theoretically and in applications. The techniques can be grouped into time-continuous control schemes based on Pyragas, and the two Poincare-based chaos control schemes, Ott-Gebogi-Yorke (OGY) and difference control. Here, a new stability analysis of these two Poincare-based chaos control schemes is given by means of the Floquet theory. This approach allows to calculate exactly the stability restrictions occurring for small measurement delays and for an impulse length shorter than the length of the orbit. This is of practical experimental relevance; to avoid a selection of the relative impulse length by trial and error, it is advised to investigate whether the used control scheme itself shows systematic limitations on the choice of the impulse length. To investigate this point, a Floquet analysis is performed. For OGY control the influence of the impulse length is marginal. As an unexpected result, difference control fails when the impulse length is taken longer than a maximal value that is approximately one half of the orbit length for small Ljapunov numbers and decreases with the Ljapunov number.},

  abstract = {The spatial structure of populations is a key element in the understanding of the large-scale spreading of epidemics. Motivated by the recent empirical evidence on the heterogeneous properties of transportation and commuting patterns among urban areas, we present a thorough analysis of the behavior of infectious diseases in metapopulation models characterized by heterogeneous connectivity and mobility patterns. We derive the basic reaction-diffusion equations describing the metapopulation system at the mechanistic level and derive an early stage dynamics approximation for the subpopulation invasion dynamics. The analytical description uses a homogeneous assumption on degree block variables that allows us to take into account arbitrary degree distribution of the metapopulation network. We show that along with the usual single population epidemic threshold the metapopulation network exhibits a global threshold for the subpopulation invasion. We find an explicit analytic expression for the invasion threshold that determines the minimum number of individuals traveling among subpopulations in order to have the infection of a macroscopic number of subpopulations. The invasion threshold is a function of factors such as the basic reproductive number, the infectious period and the mobility process and it is found to decrease for increasing network heterogeneity. We provide extensive mechanistic numerical Monte Carlo simulations that recover the analytical finding in a wide range of metapopulation network connectivity patterns. The results can be useful in the understanding of recent data driven computational approaches to disease spreading in large transportation networks and the effect of containment measures such as travel restrictions.},

The m infinity and h infinity parameters of the sodium conductance system were shifted along the voltage axis in opposite directions so that their relative overlap was increased approximately 7 mV. Time constants tau m and tau h, were moved in a similar manner. Voltage-dependent parameters of delayed potassium conductance, n infinity and tau n, were shifted 4.3 mV in the positive direction and tau n was uniformly increased by a factor of 2. Leakage conductance and capacitance were unchanged. Repetitive activity of this modified circuit was qualitatively similar to that of the standard model. A fifth branch was added to the circuit representing a transient potassium conductance system present in the repetitive walking leg axons and in other repetitive neurons. This model, with various parameter choices, fired repetitively down to approximately 2 spikes/s and up to 350/s. The frequency vs. stimulus current plot could be fit well by a straight line over a decade of the low frequency range and the general appearance of the spike trains was similar to that of other repetitive neurons. Stimulus intensities were of the same order as those which produce repetitive activity in the standard Hodgkin-Huxley axon. The repetitive firing rate and first spike latency (utilization time) were found to be most strongly influenced by the inactivation time constant of the transient potassium conductance (tau b), the delayed potassium conductance (tau n), and the value of leakage conductance (gL). The model presents a mechanism by which stable low frequency discharge can be generated by millisecond-order membrane conductance changes.},

  abstract = {The minimal integrate-and-fire-or-burst (IFB) neuron model reproduces the salient features of experimentally observed thalamocortical (TC) relay neuron response properties, including the temporal tuning of both tonic spiking (i.e., conventional action potentials) and postinhibitory rebound bursting mediated by a low-threshold calcium current. In this paper we consider networks of IFB neurons with slow synaptic interactions and show how the dynamics may be described with a smooth firing-rate model. When the firing rate of the IFB model is dominated by a refractory process the equations of motion simplify and may be solved exactly. Numerical simulations are used to show that a pair of reciprocally interacting inhibitory spiking IFB TC neurons supports an alternating rhythm of the type predicted from the firing-rate theory. A change in a single parameter of the IFB neuron allows it to fire a burst of spikes in response to a depolarizing signal, so that it mimics the behavior of a reticular (RE) cell. Within a continuum model we show that a network of RE cells with on-center excitation can support a fast traveling pulse. In contrast, a network of inhibitory TC cells is found to support a slowly propagating lurching pulse.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we study the effect of two distinct discrete delays on the dynamics of a Wilson&#8211;Cowan neural network. This activity-based model describes the dynamics of synaptically interacting excita tory and inhibitory neuronal populations. We discuss the interpretation of the delays in the language of neurobiology and show how they can contribute to the generation of network rhythms. First, we focus on the use of linear stability theory to show how to destabilize a fixed point, leading to the onset of oscillatory behaviour. Next, we show for the choice of a Heaviside nonlinearity for the firing rate that such emerg ent oscillations can be either synchronous or anti-synchronous, depending on whether inhibition or excitation dominates the network architecture. To probe the behaviour of smooth (sigmoidal) nonlinear firing rate s, we use a mixture of numerical bifurcation analysis and direct simulations, and uncover parameter windows that support chaotic behaviour. Finally, we comment on the role of delays in the generation of oscillat ions, and discuss natural extensions of the work in this paper.},

Furthermore, how does this likelihood depend on the spatial and temporal proximity of the co-occurrences? Such issues arise in data originating in both online and offline domains as well as settings that capture interfaces between online and offline behavior. Here we develop a framework for quantifying the answers to such questions, and we apply this framework to publicly available data from a social media site, finding that even a very small number of co-occurrences can result in a high empirical likelihood of a social tie. We then present probabilistic models showing how such large probabilities can arise from a natural model of proximity and co-occurrence in the presence of social ties. In addition to providing a method for establishing some of the first quantifiable estimates of these measures, our findings have potential privacy implications, particularly for the ways in which social structures can be inferred from public online records that capture individuals&#8217; physical locations over time.},

We present an application of extended time delay autosynchronization introduced by Socolar et al. [Phys. Rev. E 50, 3245 (1994)] to an unstable focus. This system represents a generic model of an unstable steady state which can be found, for instance, in Hopf bifurcation. In addition to the original controller design, we investigate effects of control loop latency and a bandpass filter on the domain of control. Furthermore, we consider coupling of the control force to the system via a rotational coupling matrix parametrized by a variable phase. We present an analysis of the domain of control and support our results by numerical calculations.},

Phase randomization is achieved by driving the neuron&#8217;s state to its phaseless set, a point at which its phase is undefined and is extremely sensitive to background noise. We consider the biologically relevant case of a fixed magnitude constraint on the stimulus signal, and show how the control objective can be accomplished in minimum time. The control synthesis problem is addressed using the minimum-time-optimal Hamilton&#8211;Jacobi&#8211;Bellman framework, which is quite general and can be applied to any spiking neuron model in the conductance-based Hodgkin&#8211;Huxley formalism. We also use this methodology to compute a feedback control protocol for optimal spike rate increase. This framework provides a straightforward means of visualizing isochrons, without actually calculating them in the traditional way. Finally, we present an extension of the phase randomizing control scheme that is applied at the population level, to a network of globally coupled neurons that are firing in synchrony. The applied control signal desynchronizes the population in a demand-controlled way.},

  abstract = {A growing body of neuroimaging research has documented that, in the absence of an explicit task, the brain shows temporally coherent activity. This so-called &#8220;resting state&#8221; activity or, more explicitly, the default-mode network, has been associated with daydreaming, free association, stream of consciousness, or inner rehearsal in humans, but similar patterns have also been found under anesthesia and in monkeys. Spatiotemporal activity patterns in the default-mode network are both complex and consistent, which raises the question whether they are the expression of an interesting cognitive architecture or the consequence of intrinsic network constraints. In numerical simulation, we studied the dynamics of a simplified cortical network using 38 noise-driven (Wilson&#8211;Cowan) oscillators, which in isolation remain just below their oscillatory threshold. Time delay coupling based on lengths and strengths of primate corticocortical pathways leads to the emergence of 2 sets of 40-Hz oscillators. The sets showed synchronization that was anticorrelated at <0.1 Hz across the sets in line with a wide range of recent experimental observations. Systematic variation of conduction velocity, coupling strength, and noise level indicate a high sensitivity of emerging synchrony as well as simulated blood flow blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) on the underlying parameter values. Optimal sensitivity was observed around conduction velocities of 1&#8211;2 m/s, with very weak coupling between oscillators. An additional finding was that the optimal noise level had a characteristic scale, indicating the presence of stochastic resonance, which allows the network dynamics to respond with high sensitivity to changes in diffuse feedback activity.},

A general approach is presented, based on the master stability function, Gershg\"{o}rin disc theory and the extreme value theory in statistics, to yield constraints on the distribution of coupling to ensure the stability of synchronized dynamics. Three types of different behaviour: global-stable, exponential-stable and power-stable, are found, depending on the nature of the distribution of the interactions between units. Systems with specific coupling schemes are used as examples to illustrate our general method.},

  abstract = {A common approach to measure and assess cortical dynamics focuses on the analysis of mass signals, such as the local field potential (LFP), as an indicator for the underlying network activity. To improve our understanding of how such field potentials and cortical spiking dynamics are related, we analyzed the phase and amplitude relationships between extracellular recordings from motor cortex of monkey in a delayed pointing task. We applied methods from phase synchronization analysis to extract the instantaneous phase of the LFP time series and to characterize the degree of phase coupling between the spike train and oscillation cycles in a frequency-independent manner. In particular, we investigated the dependence of observed phase preferences on the different periods of a behavioral trial. Furthermore, we present evidence to support the hypothesis that increased LFP oscillation amplitudes are related to a stronger degree of synchronization between the LFP and spike signals. However, neurons tend to keep a fixed phase relationship to the LFP independent of the amplitude or the choice of the electrode used to record the LFP.

  abstract = {Randomly-connected networks of integrate-and-fire (IF) neurons are known to display asynchronous irregular (AI) activity states, which resemble the discharge activity recorded in the cerebral cortex of awake animals. However, it is not clear whether such activity states are specific to simple IF models, or if they also exist in networks where neurons are endowed with complex intrinsic properties similar to electrophysiological measurements. Here, we investigate the occurrence of AI states in networks of nonlinear IF neurons, such as the adaptive exponential IF (Brette-Gerstner-Izhikevich) model. This model can display intrinsic properties such as low-threshold spike (LTS), regular spiking (RS) or fast-spiking (FS). We successively investigate the oscillatory and AI dynamics of thalamic, cortical and thalamocortical networks using such models. AI states can be found in each case, sometimes with surprisingly small network size of the order of a few tens of neurons. We show that the presence of LTS neurons in cortex or in thalamus, explains the robust emergence of AI states for relatively small network sizes. Finally, we investigate the role of spike-frequency adaptation (SFA). In cortical networks with strong SFA in RS cells, the AI state is transient, but when SFA is reduced, AI states can be self-sustained for long times. In thalamocortical networks, AI states are found when the cortex is itself in an AI state, but with strong SFA, the thalamocortical network displays Up and Down state transitions, similar to intracellular recordings during slow-wave sleep or anesthesia. Self-sustained Up and Down states could also be generated by two-layer cortical networks with LTS cells. These models suggest that intrinsic properties such as adaptation and low-threshold bursting activity are crucial for the genesis and control of AI states in thalamocortical networks},

Further, they continuously, selectively and independently adapt the amount of resources allocated to each of their collaborations in order to maximize the obtained payoff. We show analytically that the system approaches a state in which the agents make identical investments, and links produce identical benefits. Despite this high degree of social coordination, some agents manage to secure privileged topological positions in the network, enabling them to extract high payoffs. Our analytical investigations provide a rationale for the emergence of unidirectional non-reciprocal collaborations and different responses to the withdrawal of a partner from an interaction that have been reported in the psychological literature.},

  abstract = {The dynamics of networks of interacting systems depends intricately on the interaction topology. When the dynamics is explored, generally the whole topology has to be considered. However, here we show that there are certain mesoscale subgraphs that have precise and distinct consequences for the system-level dynamics. In particular, if mesoscale symmetries are present then eigenvectors of the Jacobian localize on the symmetric subgraph and the corresponding eigenvalues become insensitive to the topology outside the subgraph. Hence, dynamical instabilities associated with these eigenvalues can be analysed without considering the topology of the embedding network. While such instabilities are thus generated entirely in small subgraphs, they generally do not remain confined to the subgraph once the instability sets in and thus have system-level consequences. Here we illustrate the analytical investigation of such instabilities in an ecological metapopulation model consisting of a network of delay-coupled delay oscillators.},

  abstract = {A new family of graphs, entangled networks, with optimal properties in many respects, is introduced. By definition, their topology is such that it optimizes synchronizability for many dynamical processes. These networks are shown to have an extremely homogeneous structure: degree, node distance, betweenness, and loop distributions are all very narrow. Also, they are characterized by a very interwoven (entangled) structure with short average distances, large loops, and no well-defined community structure. This family of nets exhibits an excellent performance with respect to other flow properties such as robustness against errors and attacks, minimal first-passage time of random walks, efficient communication, etc. These remarkable features convert entangled networks in a useful concept, optimal or almost optimal in many senses, and with plenty of potential applications in computer science or neuroscience.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a new approach for analysing the structural properties of time series from complex systems. Starting from the concept of recurrences in phase space, the recurrence matrix of a time series is interpreted as the adjacency matrix of an associated complex network, which links different points in time if the considered states are closely neighboured in phase space. In comparison with similar network-based techniques the new approach has important conceptual advantages, and can be considered as a unifying framework for transforming time series into complex networks that also includes other existing methods as special cases. It has been demonstrated here that there are fundamental relationships between many topological properties of recurrence networks and different nontrivial statistical properties of the phase space density of the underlying dynamical system. Hence, this novel interpretation of the recurrence matrix yields new quantitative characteristics (such as average path length, clustering coefficient, or centrality measures of the recurrence network) related to the dynamical complexity of a time series, most of which are not yet provided by other existing methods of nonlinear time series analysis.},

Next, we consider phase models with stronger coupling and delays in the state variables. We show that they have a richer dynamics but one that is still similar to the weakly coupled case.},

Kobayashi, IEEE J. Quantum Electron. QE-16, 347 (1980)]. We show that two different scenarios are possible. If the linewidth enhancement factor is relatively large (alpha=2-5), the beating occurs between a stable ECM (mode) and an unstable ECM (antimode). The stability of the time-periodic solution is then limited in parameter space. But if the linewidth enhancement factor is sufficiently low (alphaless than or equal toalpha(c)similar or equal to1), a beating between two stable modes is possible allowing stable high-frequency oscillating outputs.},

For two oscillators, we derive return maps for subsequent phase differences, and construct phase diagrams for a broad range of parameters. In-phase synchronization proves stable for inhibitory coupling and unstable for excitatory coupling if the delay is not zero. If the coupling strength is high, additional regimes with marginally stable synchronization are found. Simulations with N&#8811;2 oscillators reveal a complex dynamics including spontaneous synchronization and desynchronization with excitatory coupling, and multistable phase clustering with inhibitory coupling. We simulate a continuous description of the system for N&#8594;&#8734; oscillators and demonstrate that these phenomena are independent of the size of the system. Phase clustering is shown to relate to stability and basins of attraction of fixed points in the return map of two oscillators. Our findings are generic in the sense that they qualitatively are robust with respect to modeling details. We demonstrate this using also pulses of finite rise time and the more realistic model by Hodgkin and Huxley which exhibits multistable synchronization as predicted from our analysis as well.},

We concentrate on the short coupling-time regime where the number of basic states of the system, the compound laser modes (CLMs), is small so that their individual behavior can be studied both experimentally and theoretically. As such it constitutes a prototype example of delay-coupled laser systems, which play an important role, e.g., in telecommunication. Specifically, for small spectral detuning we find several stable CLMs of the coupled system where both lasers lock onto a common frequency and emit continuous wave output. A bifurcation analysis of the CLMs in the full rate equation model with delay reveals the structure of stable and unstable CLMs. We find a characteristic bifurcation scenario as a function of the detuning and the coupling phase between the two lasers that explains experimentally observed multistabilities and mode jumps in the locking region.},

The review is an exposition of current phase transition theory in a geometrical context. As such, it includes a discussion of scaling relations between critical exponents and their calculation using series expansion methods. Renormalisation group techniques are also considered. The major difference between percolation and other phase transition models is the absence of a Hamiltonian. Instead, the theory is based entirely on probabilistic arguments. A discussion of the connections with classical probability theory is also given.},

  abstract = {Contrary to intuitive expectations, overexpression of sarco-endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca2  ATPases (SERCAs) in Xenopus oocytes leads to a decrease in the period and an increase in the amplitude of intracellular Ca2  waves. Here we examine these experimental findings by modeling Ca2  release using a modified Othmer-Tang-model. An increase in the period and a reduction in the amplitude of Ca2  wave activity are obtained when increases in SERCA density are simulated while keeping all other parameters of the model constant. However, Ca2  wave period can be reduced and the wave amplitude and velocity can be significantly increased when an increase in the luminal ER Ca2  concentration due to SERCA overexpression is incorporated into the model. Increased luminal Ca2  occurs because increased SERCA activity lowers cytosolic Ca2 , which is partially replenished by Ca2  influx across the plasma membrane. These simulations are supported by experimental data demonstrating higher luminal Ca2  levels, decreased periods, increased amplitude, and increased velocity of Ca2  waves in response to increased SERCA density.},

  abstract = {We use a simple dynamical model of two interacting networks of integrate-and-fire neurons to explain a seemingly paradoxical result observed in epileptic patients indicating that the level of phase synchrony declines below normal levels during the state preceding seizures (preictal state). We model the transition from the seizure free interval (interictal state) to the seizure (ictal state) as a slow increase in the mean depolarization of neurons in a network corresponding to the epileptic focus. We show that the transition from the interictal to preictal and then to the ictal state may be divided into separate dynamical regimes: the formation of slow oscillatory activity due to resonance between the two interacting networks observed during the interictal period, structureless activity during the preictal period when the two networks have different properties, and bursting dynamics driven by the network corresponding to the epileptic focus. Based on this result, we hypothesize that the beginning of the preictal period marks the beginning of the transition of the epileptic network from normal activity toward seizing.},

  abstract = {Words in human language interact in sentences in non{\^a}�&#8220;random ways, and allow humans to construct an astronomic variety of sentences from a limited number of discrete units. This construction process is extremely fast and robust. The co{\^a}�&#8220;occurrence of words in sentences reflects language organization in a subtle manner that can be described in terms of a graph of word interactions. Here, we show that such graphs display two important features recently found in a disparate number of complex systems. (i) The so called small{\^a}�&#8220;world effect. In particular, the average distance between two words, (i.e. the average minimum number of links to be crossed from an arbitrary word to another), is shown to be {\^a}&#8240;&#710; 2{\^a}�&#8220;3, even though the human brain can store many thousands. (ii) A scale{\^a}�&#8220;free distribution of degrees. The known pronounced effects of disconnecting the most connected vertices in such networks can be identified in some language disorders. These observations indicate some unexpected features of language organization that might reflect the evolutionary and social history of lexicons and the origins of their flexibility and combinatorial nature.},

  abstract = {Phase space methods and an analog computer are used to analyze the Hodgkin-Huxley non-linear differential equations for the squid giant axon membrane. V is the membrane potential, m the Na  activation, h the Na  inactivation, and n the K  activation. V and m change rapidly, relative to h and n. The (V, m) phase plane of a reduced system of equations, with h and n held constant at their resting values, has three singular points: a stable resting point, a threshold saddle point, and a stable excited point. When h and n are allowed to vary, recovery and refractoriness result from the movement with subsequent disappearance of the threshold and excited points. Multiplying the time constant of n by 100 or more, and that of h by one-third, reproduces the experimental plateau action potentials obtained with tetraethylammonium by Tasaki and Hagiwara, including the phenomena of abolition and of refractoriness of the plateau duration. The equations have, transiently, two stable states, as found in the real axon by these authors. Since the theoretical membrane conductance curves differ significantly from the experimental ones, further experimental analysis of ionic currents with tetraethylammonium is needed to decide whether the Hodgkin-Huxley model can be generalized to explain these experiments completely.

We show that the coupling of the Bloch and cyclotron oscillations in the tilted B geometry generates a magnetic-field-induced miniband structure and an extended electron motion across many periods of the superlattice. The spatially extended character of the electronic states is analogous to the delocalization of the electron orbit in a semiclassical description of the electron motion and explains our observation of a strong resonant enhancement of the current flow through the superlattice.},

  abstract = {This review addresses a central question in the field of complex systems: given a fluctuating (in time or space), sequentially measured set of experimental data, how should one analyze the data, assess their underlying trends, and discover the characteristics of the fluctuations that generate the experimental traces? In recent years, significant progress has been made in addressing this question for a class of stochastic processes that can be modeled by Langevin equations, including additive as well as multiplicative fluctuations or noise. Important results have emerged from the analysis of temporal data for such diverse fields as neuroscience, cardiology, finance, economy, surface science, turbulence, seismic time series and epileptic brain dynamics, to name but a few. Furthermore, it has been recognized that a similar approach can be applied to the data that depend on a length scale, such as velocity increments in fully developed turbulent flow, or height increments that characterize rough surfaces. A basic ingredient of the approach to the analysis of fluctuating data is the presence of a Markovian property, which can be detected in real systems above a certain time or length scale. This scale is referred to as the Markov&#8211;Einstein (ME) scale, and has turned out to be a useful characteristic of complex systems. We provide a review of the operational methods that have been developed for analyzing stochastic data in time and scale. We address in detail the following issues: (i) reconstruction of stochastic evolution equations from data in terms of the Langevin equations or the corresponding Fokker&#8211;Planck equations and (ii) intermittency, cascades, and multiscale correlation functions.},

Gibson et al. ) and they &#8220;may play a key role in coordinating cortical activity(M. Galarreta & S. Hestrin), little is known how they behave in the in vivo neocortex. A salient property of some interneuron systems in the neocortex is that they are coupled by gap junctions (GJs) - a kind of electrical couplings very intensively between the same type of interneurons. In our previous studies, we reported the theoretical possibility that a class of neuron systems may exhibit spatio-temporal chaos when they are coupled by GJs, while the individual neurons, when isolated, exhibit only simple repetitive firings. This dynamics is emergent, and unveils only when cells are coupled by GJs. Mathematically, this phenomenon could be an expression of chaotic itinerancy among pseudo-attractors (or, attractor ruins). In view of the ubiquity of GJs - there are at least five distinct interneuron systems coupled by GJs in the six layers of the neocortex, and in view of the significance of the concept of chaotic itinerancy in memory dynamics we give in this lecture a review about general property and collective dynamics of GJ-coupled neuronal systems.},

We give the explicit formula for a stability parameter of the synchronized state &#936;unif. When the coupling strength is weakened, the coupled system may exhibit several types of non-synchronized motion. In particular, if &#936;unif is chaotic, we always get a transition from chaotic &#936;unif to a certain non-uniform state and finally the non-uniform chaos. Details associated with such transition are investigated for the coupled Lorenz model. As an application of the theory, we propose a new experimental method to directly measure the positive Lyapunov exponent of intrinsic chaos in reaction systems.},

  abstract = {Cell polarization plays a central role in the development of complex organisms. It has been recently shown that cell polarization may follow from the proximity to a phase separation instability in a bistable network of chemical reactions. An example which has been thoroughly studied is the formation of signaling domains during eukaryotic chemotaxis. In this case, the process of domain growth may be described by the use of a constrained time-dependent Landau-Ginzburg equation, admitting scale-invariant solutions a la Lifshitz and Slyozov. The constraint results here from a mechanism of fast cycling of molecules between a cytosolic, inactive state and a membrane-bound, active state, which dynamically tunes the chemical potential for membrane binding to a value corresponding to the coexistence of different phases on the cell membrane. We provide here a universal description of this process both in the presence and in the absence of a gradient in the external activation field. Universal power laws are derived for the time needed for the cell to polarize in a chemotactic gradient, and for the value of the smallest detectable gradient. We also describe a concrete realization of our scheme based on the analysis of available biochemical and biophysical data.},

  abstract = {The complex Ginzburg&#8211;Landau equation (CGLE), probably the most celebrated nonlinear equation in physics,
 
describes generically the dynamics of oscillating, spatially extended systems close to the onset of oscillations. Using
 
symmetry arguments, this article gives an easy access to this equation and an introduction into the rich spatiotemporal
 
behaviour it describes. Starting out from the familiar linear oscillator, we first show how the generic model
 
for an individual nonlinear oscillator, the so-called Stuart&#8211;Landau equation, can be derived from symmetry
 
arguments. Then, we extend our symmetry considerations to spatially extended systems, arriving at the CGLE. A
 
comparison of diffusively coupled linear and nonlinear oscillators makes apparent the source of instability in the
 
latter systems. A concise survey of the most typical patterns in 1D and 2D is given. Finally, more recent extensions of
 
the CGLE are discussed that comprise external, time-periodic forcing as well as nonlocal and global spatial coupling.},

We show that the global oscillation of the net can be suppressed (amplitude death) via time-delayed feedback for properly chosen delay time and feedback strength. The result of a linear stability analysis fits very well to the simulations. In the amplitude death regime, weak additive noise can induce excitation waves (noise-induced pattern formation), a fingerprint of excitable network dynamics.},

In two prototype models we observe a large amplification in the interaction strength between two opposite fronts increasing front velocities several orders of magnitude. By analyzing the spatial dynamics we prove that way beyond quantitative effects, nonlocal terms can also change the overall qualitative picture by inducing oscillations in the front profile. This leads to a mechanism for the formation of localized structures not present for local interactions. Finally, nonlocal coupling can induce a steep broadening of localized structures, eventually annihilating them.},

  abstract = {Boolean Delay Equations (BDEs) are semi-discrete dynamical models with Boolean-valued variables that evolve in continuous time. Systems of BDEs can be classified into conservative or dissipative, in a manner that parallels the classification of ordinary or partial differential equations. Solutions to certain conservative BDEs exhibit growth of complexity in time; such BDEs can be seen therefore as metaphors for biological evolution or human history. Dissipative BDEs are structurally stable and exhibit multiple equilibria and limit cycles, as well as more complex, fractal solution sets, such as Devil's staircases and "fractal sunbursts." All known solutions of dissipative BDEs have stationary variance. BDE systems of this type, both free and forced, have been used as highly idealized models of climate change on interannual, interdecadal and paleoclimatic time scales. BDEs are also being used as flexible, highly efficient models of colliding cascades of loading and failure in earthquake modeling and prediction, as well as in genetics. In this paper we review the theory of systems of BDEs and illustrate their applications to climatic and solid-earth problems. The former have used small systems of BDEs, while the latter have used large hierarchical networks of BDEs. We moreover introduce BDEs with an infinite number of variables distributed in space ("partial BDEs") and discuss connections with other types of discrete dynamical systems, including cellular automata and Boolean networks. This research-and-review paper concludes with a set of open questions.},

  abstract = {Boolean delay equations (BDEs) areevolution equations for a vector of discrete variables x(t). The value of each componentXi(t), 0 or 1. depends on previous values of all componentsxj(t- tij), xi(t)=fi(x1(t-ti1),...,xn(t -tin)). BDEs model the evolution of biological and physical systems with threshold behavior and nonlinear feedbacks. The delays model distinct interaction times between pairs of variables. In this paper, BDEs are studied by algebraic, analytic, and numerical methods. It is shown that solutions depend continuously on the initial data and on the delays. BDEs are classified intoconservative anddissipative. All BDEs with rational delays only haveperiodic solutions only. But conservative BDEs with rationally unrelated delays haveaperiodic solutions of increasing complexity. These solutions can be approximated arbitrarily well by periodic solutions of increasing period.Self-similarity andintermittency of aperiodic solutions is studied as a function of delay values, and certain number-theoretic questions related toresonances and diophantine approximation are raised. Period length is shown to be a lower semicontinuous function of the delays for a given BDE, and can be evaluated explicitly for linear equations. We prove that a BDE isstructurable stable if and only if it has eventually periodic solutions of bounded period, and if the length of initial transients is bounded. It is shown that, for dissipative BDEs, asymptotic solution behavior is typically governed by areduced BDE. Applications toclimate dynamics and other problems are outlined.},

The model consists of a system of nonlinear delay differential equations. Physiological properties are taken into account as nonlinear transmission of signals at the synapse, temporal and spatial summation of incoming signals at the soma, active membrane characteristics, and dendritic and axonal propagation times. The influence of the connectivity and the temporal parameters on the oscillatory properties of the model is studied. The computer simulations are in agreement with experimental observations in cortical networks: whereas a weak excitatory or strong inhibitory synaptic connection strength produces a stationary status with short-lasting responses to external stimuli, increases in excitation or decreases in inhibition induce spontaneous and stimulus-evoked rhythmic discharges. Synaptic burst-like activity is observed only for an intermediate range of excitatory and inhibitory connection strengths and external inputs. The form and duration of the bursts can also be controlled by the temporal parameters. The results demonstrate that relatively simple mathematical equations are sufficient to model some of the network properties underlying the generation and propagation of epileptiform activity.},

The successfulness of this variable-delay feedback control (VDFC) is illustrated by a numerical control simulation of the chaotic Lorenz system using three different types of time-delay modulations: a sawtooth wave, a sine wave, and a uniform random distribution. We perform a comparative analysis between the VDFC method and the standard TDAS method for a sawtooth wave modulation by analytically determining the domains of control for the generic case of an unstable fixed point of focus type.},

  abstract = {We study the stability of unstable steady states in scalar retarded time-delayed systems subjected to a
 
variable-delay feedback control. The important aspect of such a control problem is that time-delayed systems
 
are already infinite-dimensional before the delayed feedback control is turned on. When the frequency of the
 
modulation is large compared to the system&#8217;s dynamics, the analytic approach consists of relating the stability
 
properties of the resulting variable-delay system with those of an analogous distributed-delay system. Otherwise,
 
the stability domains are obtained by a numerical integration of the linearized variable-delay system. The
 
analysis shows that the control domains are significantly larger than those in the usual time-delayed feedback
 
control, and that the complexity of the domain structure depends on the form and the frequency of the delay
 
modulation.},

  abstract = {Growing evidence suggests that synchronization among distributed neuronal networks underlie functional integration in the brain. Neural synchronization is typically revealed by a consistent phase delay between neural responses generated in two separated sources. But the influence of a third neuronal assembly in that synchrony pattern remains largely unexplored. We investigate here the potential role of the hippocampus in determining cortico-cortical theta synchronization in different behavioral states during motor quiescent and while animals actively explore the environment. To achieve this goal, the two states were modeled with a recurrent network involving the hippocampus, as a relay element, and two distant neocortical sites. We found that cortico-cortical neural coupling accompanied higher hippocampal theta oscillations in both behavioral states, although the highest level of synchronization between cortical regions emerged during motor exploration. Local field potentials recorded from the same brain regions qualitatively confirm these findings in the two behavioral states. These results suggest that zero-lag long-range cortico-cortical synchronization is likely mediated by hippocampal theta oscillations in lower mammals as a function of cognitive demands and motor acts.},

Specifically, we optically couple three semiconductor lasers to each other via an external mirror. The system exhibits natural mismatches between its three elements, and is designed so that the coupling delays and strengths are non-uniform throughout the network. For weak coupling a cluster arises where two lasers synchronize their low-frequency dynamics; for stronger coupling all three lasers synchronize. A simple model gives good agreement with the experimental observations.},

We employ two examples of such dynamics: (i)�Axelrod{\^a}��s model for social influence, and (ii) a discrete version of a bounded confidence model for opinion formation. In each case, the global interaction fields correspond to the statistical mode of the states of the agents in each population. In both systems we find localized coherent states for some values of parameters, consisting of one population in a homogeneous state and the other in a disordered state. This situation can be considered as a social analogue to a chimera state arising in two interacting populations of oscillators. In addition, other asymptotic collective behaviors appear in both systems depending on parameter values: a common homogeneous state, where both populations reach the same state; different homogeneous states, where both population reach homogeneous states different from each other; and a disordered state, where both populations reach inhomogeneous states.},

  abstract = {Waves are common in cortical networks and may be important for carrying information about a stimulus from one local circuit to another. In a recent study of visually evoked waves in rat cortex, compression and reflection of waves are observed as the activation passes from visual areas V1 to V2. The authors of this study apply bicuculline (BMI) and demonstrate that the reflection disappears. They conclude that inhibition plays a major role in compression and reflection. We present several models for propagating waves in heterogeneous media and show that the velocity and thus compression depends weakly on inhibition. We propose that the main site of action of BMI with respect to wave propagation is on the threshold for firing which we suggest is related to action on potassium channels. We combine numerical and analytic methods to explore both compression and reflection in an excitable system with synaptic coupling.},

This apparent similarity conceals essential differences across disciplines: Although physical particles are assumed to optimize the global energy, economic agents maximize their own utility. Here, we solve exactly a Schelling-like segregation model, which interpolates continuously between cooperative and individual dynamics. We show that increasing the degree of cooperativity induces a qualitative transition from a segregated phase of low utility toward a mixed phase of high utility. By introducing a simple function that links the individual and global levels, we pave the way to a rigorous approach of a wide class of systems, where dynamics are governed by individual strategies.},

Small-world topology has therefore been suggested to support network synchronization. Here we study the asymptotic speed of synchronization of coupled oscillators in dependence on the degree of randomness of their interaction topology in generalized Watts-Strogatz ensembles. We find that networks with fixed in-degree synchronize faster the more random they are, with small worlds just appearing as an intermediate case. For any generic network ensemble, if synchronization speed is at all extremal at intermediate randomness, it is slowest in the small-world regime. This phenomenon occurs for various types of oscillators, intrinsic dynamics and coupling schemes.},

It has been established that the spectrum of a Laplace-Beltrami operator with periodic metric is the union of closed intervals and that spectral gaps are possible, but whether an infinite number of spectral gaps is possible is an open question. Utilizing special transformations it is shown that there are two-dimensional Laplace-Beltrami operators having an arbitrarily large number of spectral gaps by proving that a particular two-dimensional operator has an infinite number of spectral gaps. In the case of a periodic conformal metric relationships between the scalar curvature and the number of gaps are investigated.},

  abstract = {We present a universal approach to the investigation of the dynamics in generalized models. In these models
 
the processes that are taken into account are not restricted to specific functional forms. Therefore a single
 
generalized models can describe a class of systems which share a similar structure. Despite this generality, the
 
proposed approach allows us to study the dynamical properties of generalized models efficiently in the framework
 
of local bifurcation theory. The approach is based on a normalization procedure that is used to identify
 
natural parameters of the system. The Jacobian in a steady state is then derived as a function of these
 
parameters. The analytical computation of local bifurcations using computer algebra reveals conditions for the
 
local asymptotic stability of steady states and provides certain insights on the global dynamics of the system.
 
The proposed approach yields a close connection between modelling and nonlinear dynamics. We illustrate the
 
investigation of generalized models by considering examples from three different disciplines of science: a
 
socioeconomic model of dynastic cycles in china, a model for a coupled laser system and a general ecological
 
food web.},

The resulting theoretical current-voltage (I-V) characteristics of tunnel diodes and solar cells when measured via four-wire techniques are calculated and compared with experimentally measured I-V curves. Solutions to overcome the measurement difficulties are provided, and a method to infer the maximum tunneling current density of tunnel diodes in a device with solar cells is discussed. This paper also describes how the elsewhere-observed ostensible hysteresis with multijunction solar cells is caused by the measurement setup or by large internal series resistances.}},

  abstract = {The recurrent excitatory and inhibitory connections between and within layers of the cerebral cortex are fundamental to the operation of local cortical circuits. Models of cortical function often assume that recurrent excitation and inhibition are balanced, and we recently demonstrated that spontaneous network activity in vitro contains a precise balance of excitation and inhibition; however, the existence of a balance between excitation and inhibition in the intact and spontaneously active cerebral cortex has not been directly tested. We examined this hypothesis in the prefrontal cortex in vivo, during the slow (<1 Hz) oscillation in ketamine&#8211;xylazine-anesthetized ferrets. We measured persistent network activity (Up states) with extracellular multiple unit and local field potential recording, while simultaneously recording synaptic currents in nearby cells. We determined the reversal potential and conductance change over time during Up states and found that the body of Up state activity exhibited a steady reversal potential (&#8211;37 mV on average) for hundreds of milliseconds, even during substantial (21 nS on average) changes in membrane conductance. Furthermore, we found that both the initial and final segments of the Up state were characterized by significantly more depolarized reversal potentials and concomitant increases in excitatory conductance, compared with the stable middle portions of Up states. This ongoing temporal evolution between excitation and inhibition, which exhibits remarkable proportionality within and across neurons in active local networks, may allow for rapid transitions between relatively stable network states, permitting the modulation of neuronal responsiveness in a behaviorally relevant manner.},

  abstract = {{Donald Hebb pioneered many current themes in behavioural neuroscience. He saw psychology as a biological science, but one in which the organization of behaviour must remain the central concern. Through penetrating theoretical concepts, including the "cell assembly," "phase sequence," and "Hebb synapse," he offered a way to bridge the gap between cells, circuits and behaviour. He saw the brain as a dynamically organized system of multiple distributed parts, with roots that extend into foundations of development and evolutionary heritage. He understood that behaviour, as brain, can be sliced at various levels and that one of our challenges is to bring these levels into both conceptual and empirical register. He could move between theory and fact with an ease that continues to inspire both students and professional investigators. Although facts continue to accumulate at an accelerating rate in both psychology and neuroscience, and although these facts continue to force revision in the details of Hebb's earlier contributions, his overall insistence that we look at behaviour and brain together {\^a}�� within a dynamic, relational and multilayered framework {\^a}�� remains. His work touches upon current studies of population coding, contextual factors in brain representations, synaptic plasticity, developmental construction of brain/behaviour relations, clinical syndromes, deterioration of performance with age and disease, and the formal construction of connectionist models. The collection of papers in this volume represent these and related themes that Hebb inspired. We also acknowledge our appreciation for Don Hebb as teacher, colleague and friend.}},

  abstract = {Synchronization phenomena of two chaotically emitting semiconductor lasers subject to delayed optical feedback are investigated. The lasers are unidirectionally coupled via their optical fields. Our experimental and numerical studies demonstrate that the relative optical feedback phase is of decisive importance: a characteristic synchronization scenario evolves under variation of the relative optical-feedback phase mediating cyclically between chaos synchronization in conjunction with coherent fields, and uncorrelated states in conjunction with incoherent fields. As a key result, we propose, and numerically demonstrate, a novel ON/OFF phase shift keying method opening up new perspectives for applications in communication systems using chaotic carriers.},

  abstract = {We present a general framework for the study of coevolution in dynamical systems. This phenomenon consists of the coexistence of two dynamical processes on networks of interacting elements: node state change and rewiring of links between nodes. The process of rewiring is described in terms of two basic actions: disconnection and reconnection between nodes, both based on a mechanism of comparison of their states. We assume that the process of rewiring and node state change occur with probabilities P r and P c , respectively, independent of each other. The collective behavior of a coevolutionary system can be characterized on the space of parameters ( P r , P c ). As an application, for a voter-like node dynamics we find that reconnections between nodes with similar states lead to network fragmentation. The critical boundaries for the onset of fragmentation in networks with different properties are calculated on this space. We show that coevolution models correspond to curves on this space describing functional relations between P r and P c . The occurrence of a one-large-domain phase and a fragmented phase in the network is predicted for diverse models, and agreement is found with some earlier results. The collective behavior of the system is also characterized on the space of parameters for the disconnection and reconnection actions. In a region of this space, we find a behavior where different node states can coexist for very long times on one large, connected network.},

  abstract = {To detect what initiates spreading depression (SD), the early prodromal events were investigated in hippocampal CA1 of urethane-anesthetized rats. SD was provoked by microdialysis or focal microinjection of high- K  solution. Extracellular DC potentials and extracellular potassium concentration ([K ]o) were recorded, and spontaneous and evoked potentials analyzed for current source-density (CSD). In the front of an approaching SD wave, several seconds before the onset of the typical sustained negative potential shift (delta Vo) and the increased [K ]o, fast electrical activity was detected. This consisted initially of small rhythmic (60-70 Hz) sawtooth wavelets, which then gave way to a shower of population spikes (PSs) of identical frequency. Prodromal wavelets and PSs were synchronized over considerable distances in the tissue. Sawtooth wavelets were identified as pacemakers of the prodromal PS burst. Simultaneous recording at three depths revealed that the spontaneous prodromal PSs occurred exactly in phase in dendrites and somata whereas synaptically transmitted PSs arose first in the proximal dendrites and were conducted from there into the soma membrane. During a spike burst, stratum (st.) pyramidale served as current sink, while in the proximal sublayer of st. radiatum spike- sinks gave way to spike sources that grew larger as the sinks in st. pyramidale began to subside. Blocking synaptic transmission did not abolish the prodromal spike burst, yet repetitive orthodromic activation inhibited it without altering the subsequent SD waveform. Complex changes in cell excitability were detected even before fast spontaneous activities. We concluded that, in the initial evolution of SD, changes in neuron function precede the regenerating depolarization by several seconds. We propose that the opening of normally closed electric junctions among neurons can best explain the long-distance synchronization and the flow current that occurs in the leading edge of a propagating wave of SD. },

Focusing on phase transitions from fluctuating phases into absorbing states, the universality class of directed percolation is investigated in detail. The survey gives a general introduction to various lattice models of directed percolation and studies their scaling properties, field-theoretic aspects, numerical techniques, as well as possible experimental realizations. In addition, several examples of absorbing-state transitions which do not belong to the directed percolation universality class will be discussed. As a closely related technique, we investigate the concept of damage spreading. It is shown that this technique is ambiguous to some extent, making it impossible to define chaotic and regular phases in stochastic non-equilibrium systems. Finally, we discuss various classes of depinning transitions in models for interface growth which are related to phase transitions into absorbing states. },

and the competing influences of local and global features are elaborated. We derive an algebraic scaling of the transient time and confirm our findings by numerical simulations in dependence on feedback gain and time delay.},

larger network, we focus on two diffusively coupled subsystems, which can be interpreted as two mutually interacting
 
neural populations. Each system is prepared in the excitable regime and subject to independent random fluctuations. In
 
order to modify their cooperative dynamics, we apply a local external stimulus in form of an extended time-delayed
 
feedback loop that involves multiple delays weighted by a memory parameter and investigate if
 
local control applied to a subsystem can allow one to steer the global cooperative dynamics. Depending on the
 
choice of this new control parameter, we investigate different measures to quantify the influence on synchronization:
 
ratio of interspike intervals, power spectrum, interspike interval distribution, and phase
 
synchronization intervals. We show that the control method is more robust for increasing memory parameter.},

  abstract = {A great variety of systems in nature, society and technology can be modeled as graphs of vertices coupled by edges. The network structure, describing how the graph is wired, helps us understand, predict and optimize the behavior of dynamic systems. In many cases, however, the edges are not continuously active. As an example, in networks of communication via email, text messages, or phone calls, edges represent sequences of instantaneous or practically instantaneous contacts. In some cases, edges are active for non-negligible periods of time: e.g., the proximity patterns of inpatients at hospitals can be represented by a graph where an edge between two individuals is on throughout the time they are at the same ward. Like network topology, the temporal structure of edge activations can affect dynamics of systems interacting through the network, from disease contagion on the network of patients to information diffusion over an e-mail network. In this review, we present the emergent field of temporal networks, and discuss methods for analyzing topological and temporal structure and models for elucidating their relation to the behavior of dynamic systems. In the light of traditional network theory, one can see this framework as moving the information of when things happen from the dynamic system on the network, to the network itself. Since fundamental properties, such as the transitivity of edges, do not necessarily hold in temporal networks, many of these methods need to be quite different from those for static networks. The study of temporal networks is very interdisciplinary in nature. Reflecting this, even the object of study has many names - temporal graphs, evolving graphs, time-varying graphs, time-aggregated graphs, time-stamped graphs, dynamic networks, dynamic graphs, dynamical graphs, and so on. },

  abstract = {Computational properties of use of biological organisms or to the construction of computers can emerge as collective properties of systems having a large number of simple equivalent components (or neurons). The physical meaning of content-addressable memory is described by an appropriate phase space flow of the state of a system. A model of such a system is given, based on aspects of neurobiology but readily adapted to integrated circuits. The collective properties of this model produce a content-addressable memory which correctly yields an entire memory from any subpart of sufficient size. The algorithm for the time evolution of the state of the system is based on asynchronous parallel processing. Additional emergent collective properties include some capacity for generalization, familiarity recognition, categorization, error correction, and time sequence retention. The collective properties are only weakly sensitive to details of the modeling or the failure of individual devices.},

It is shown and heuristically proven that the entropy growth rate and second-largest eigenvalue of Markov matrices scale on average with the dimension of the matrices d as h ~log(O( d )) and |&#957;|~ d &#8722;1/2 , respectively, yielding the asymptotic relation h &#964; c ~1/2 between the entropy h and the correlation decay time &#964; = &#8722;1/log|&#957;|.

Some novel and useful criteria are derived by utilizing a different technique compared with some correspondingly previous results. As a special case, some sufficient conditions ensuring the exponential synchronization for a class of coupled neural networks with distributed delays are obtained. Furthermore, a feasible region of the control parameters is derived for the realization of exponential synchronization. It is worth noting that the synchronized state in this paper is not an isolated node but a non-decoupled state, in which the inner coupling matrix and the degree of the nodes play a central role. Additionally, the traditional assumptions on control width, non-control width, and discrete delays are removed in our results. Finally, some numerical simulations are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control method.},

We consider two types of delays: transmission delays between interacting elements and processing, cognitive, or execution delays at each element. We establish the scaling theory for the phase boundary of synchronization and for the steady-state fluctuations in the synchronizable regime. Further, we provide the asymptotic behavior near the boundary of the synchronizable regime. Our results also imply the potential for optimization and trade-offs in synchronization problems with time delays.},

  abstract = {Background: Little is known about temporal and spatial progression of the stroke-like lesion during the acute stage of the stroke-like episode in patients with mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS). Methods: In four stroke-like episodes of MELAS observed in three patients, MRI, EEG, and SPECT were studied consecutively within the first month of the onset. Results: The first presenting symptoms were headache in all four stroke-like episodes, followed by hemianopsia, psychosis, and aphasia. In three episodes, epileptic seizure developed subsequently in close association with a progression of stroke-like lesion. In all four episodes, serial MRI showed a slowly progressive spread of the stroke-like lesion evolving from the temporal cortex to the surrounding parietal or occipital cortex over a few weeks following the onset of initial symptoms. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps showed slightly decreased ADC values in the actively evolving brain lesions compared with those in nonaffected regions of the brain. EEG showed a pattern of focal periodic epileptiform discharges in three episodes. SPECT showed a focal hyperemia in all four stroke-like lesions, in two of which focal hyperemia persisted for the first month. A T1-weighted hyperintense cortical signal on MRI compatible with cortical laminar necrosis was seen during the subacute stage of all stroke-like lesions. Conclusion: Slowly and progressively spreading stroke-like lesions on MRI may reflect ongoing neuronal metabolic derangement associated with concomitant vasogenic edema provoked by prolonged epileptic seizure activities.},

  abstract = {Bifurcation mechanisms involved in the generation of action potentials (spikes) by neurons are reviewed here. We show how the type of bifurcation determines the neuro-computational properties of the cells. For example, when the rest state is near a saddle-node bifurcation, the cell can fire all-or-none spikes with an arbitrary low frequency, it has a well-defined threshold manifold, and it acts as an integrator; i.e. the higher the frequency of incoming pulses, the sooner it fires. In contrast, when the rest state is near an Andronov-Hopf bifurcation, the cell fires in a certain frequency range, its spikes are not all-or-none, it does not have a well-defined threshold manifold, it call fire in response to an inhibitory pulse, and it acts as a resonator; i.e. it responds preferentially to a certain (resonant) frequency of the input. Increasing the input frequency may actually delay or terminate its firing.
 

 
We also describe the phenomenon of neural bursting, and we use geometric bifurcation theory to extend the existing classification of bursters, including many new types. We discuss how the type of burster defines its neuro-computational properties, and we show that different bursters can interact, synchronize and process information differently.},

The network consists of cortical spiking neurons with axonal conduction delays and spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP); a ready-to-use MATLAB code is included. It exhibits sleeplike oscillations, gamma (40 Hz) rhythms, conversion of firing rates to spike timings, and other interesting regimes. Due to the interplay between the delays and STDP, the spiking neurons spontaneously self-organize into groups and generate patterns of stereotypical polychronous activity. To our surprise, the number of coexisting polychronous groups far exceeds the number of neurons in the network, resulting in an unprecedented memory capacity of the system. We speculate on the significance of polychrony to the theory of neuronal group selection (TNGS, neural Darwinism), cognitive neural computations, binding and gamma rhythm, mechanisms of attention, and consciousness as "attention to memories.".},

For infinitely large sparse networks of spiking neurons, mean field theory shows that a balanced state of highly irregular activity arises under various conditions. Here we analytically investigate the microscopic irregular dynamics in finite networks of arbitrary connectivity, keeping track of all individual spike times. For delayed, purely inhibitory interactions we demonstrate that any irregular dynamics that characterizes the balanced state is not chaotic but rather stable and convergent towards periodic orbits. These results highlight that chaotic and stable dynamics may be equally irregular.},

  abstract = {Neuronal synchronization plays an important role in the various functionality of nervous system such as binding, cognition, information processing, and computation. In this paper, we investigated how random and intentional failures in the nodes of a network influence its phase synchronization properties. We considered both artificially constructed networks using models such as preferential attachment, Watts-Strogatz, and Erdo&#8224;s-Re�nyi as well as a number of real neuronal networks. The failure strategy was either random or intentional based on properties of the nodes such as degree, clustering coefficient, betweenness centrality, and vulnerability. Hindmarsh-Rose model was considered as the mathematical model for the individual neurons, and the phase synchronization of the spike trains was monitored as a function of the percentage=number of removed nodes. The numerical simulations were supplemented by considering coupled non-identical Kuramoto oscillators. Failures based on the clustering coefficient, i.e., removing the nodes with high values of the clustering coefficient, had the least effect on the spike synchrony in all of the networks. This was followed by errors where the nodes were removed randomly. However, the behavior of the other three attack strategies was not uniform across the networks, and different strategies were the most influential in different network structure.},

  abstract = {All biological systems can be classified as open, dissipative and non-linear. This review introduces the most typical phenomena associated with non-linearity, dissipation and openness in biological systems. Namely, damped oscillations, self-oscillations, synchronisation, chaotic and noise-induced oscillations are explained, and illustrated by examples from various biological systems. The link is made between the experimentally registered activities and their mathematical counterparts with the help of the qualitative theory of ordinary differential equations. We introduce the ideas of non-linear and oscillatory thinking proposed by Mandelstam in the 1930s, and show how they can be applied to biological systems. An emphasis is made on the intuitive explanation of mathematical concepts rather than mathematical rigour.},

The purpose and limitations of deterministic thermostats are discussed in the context of irreversible thermodynamics and the development of theories of nonequilibrium phenomena. We draw parallels between the development of such nonequilibrium theories and the development of notions of ergodicity in equilibrium theories.},

  abstract = {Dynamic networks are studied by sociologists to understand network evolution, belief formation, friendship formation, etc. Companies make and receive different impacts from other companies in different periods. If one can understand what types of network changes affect a company&#8217;s value, then one would be able to predict the future value of the company, grasp industry innovations, and make business more successful. However, it is often difficult to collect continuous records of network changes, and the models of mining longitudinal network are complicated. In this study, we developed algorithms and a system to infer large-scale evolutionary company networks from public news during 1981&#8211;2009. Then, based on how networks change over time, and on the financial information of the companies, we predicted company profit and revenue growth. Herein, we propose a feature extraction and selection algorithm for longitudinal networks. This paper is the first to describe a study examining longitudinal network-mining-based company performance analysis. We measured how networks affect company performance and what network features are important.},

Our reported results include the following: (1) Synchronization of spike-burst activity is a multi-time scale phenomenon and burst synchrony is easier to achieve than spike synchrony. (2) Synchrony of networks with time-delayed connections can be achieved at lower coupling strengths than within the same network with instantaneous couplings. (3) The introduction of parameter dispersion into the network destroys the existence of synchrony in the strict sense, but the network dynamics in major regimes of the parameter space can still be effectively captured by a mean field approach if the couplings are excitatory. Our results on synchronization of spiking networks are general of nature and will aid in the development of minimal models of neuronal populations. The latter are the building blocks of large scale brain networks relevant for cognitive processing.},

  abstract = {Spatially continuous networks with heterogeneous connections are ubiquitous in biological systems, in particular neural systems. To understand the mutual effects of locally homogeneous and globally he terogeneous connectivity, we investigate the stability of the rest-state activity of a neural field as a function of its connectivity. The variation of the connectivity is operationalized through manipulation of a heterogeneous two-point connection embedded into the otherwise homogeneous connectivity matrix, as well as by variation of connectivity strength and a finite transmission speed. The latter results in a time del ay of communication among individual brain areas. We demonstrate that the local connectivity generates the well-known power-law behaviour of the electroencephalographic power spectrum with an exponent close to &#8722;2 , whereas the global connections generate a more characteristic line spectrum. These spectral characteristics are routinely observed in large-scale topographies of the human brain.},

As the cause of such a bursty behavior two main mechanisms have been suggested: (i) inhomogeneities due to the circadian and weekly activity patterns and (ii) inhomogeneities rooted in human task execution behavior. In this paper, we investigate the role of these mechanisms by developing and then applying systematic de-seasoning methods to remove the circadian and weekly patterns from the time series of mobile phone communication events of individuals. We find that the heavy tails in the inter-event time distributions remain robust with respect to this procedure, which clearly indicates that the human task execution-based mechanism is a possible cause of the remaining burstiness in temporal mobile phone communication patterns.},

Good quantitative agreement is found between calculations and experiment. In the case of the pitchfork are find that natural imperfections override the effects of the noise. However, novel noise amplification effects have been uncovered in the study of the Hopf bifurcation. These destroy the critical event found in the noise-free case and could be of considerable practical importance in systems containing dynamic bifurcations.}},

A third unit may be able to record and to manipulate the exchanged signal. Can the third unit synchronize to the common chaotic trajectory, as well? If all parameters of the system are public, a proof is given that the recording system can synchronize as well. However, if the two interacting systems use private commutative filters to generate the exchanged signal, a driven system cannot synchronize. It is shown that with dynamic private filters the chaotic trajectory even cannot be calculated. Hence two-way (interaction) is better than one-way (drive). The implication of this general result to secret communication with chaos synchronization is discussed.},

Complete synchronization can be achieved when all chaotic nodes are influenced by an identical set of delays and in particular for the limiting case of homogeneous delays. Results are supported by simulations of chaotic systems, self-consistent and mixing arguments, as well as analytical solutions of Bernoulli maps.},

We present a new nonlocal mechanism governing the periodic activity mode: the greatest common divisor (GCD) of network loops. For a stimulus to one node, the network splits into GCD-clusters in which cluster neurons are in zero-lag synchronization. For complex external stimuli, the number of clusters can be any common divisor. The synchronized mode and the transients to synchronization pinpoint the type of external stimuli. The findings, supported by an information mixing argument and simulations of Hodgkin-Huxley population dynamic networks with unidirectional connectivity and synaptic noise, call for reexamining sources of correlated activity in cortex and shorter information processing time scales.},

Two-color pump-probe experiments are used to localize lasing and non-lasing quantum dots within the inhomogeneously broadened ground state. Single-color results yield similar gain recovery rates of the ground state for lasing and non-lasing quantum dots decreasing from 6 ps to 2 ps with increasing injection current. We find that ground state gain dynamics are influenced solely by the injection current and unaffected by laser operation of the excited state. This independence is promising for dual-state operation schemes in quantum dot based optoelectronic devices.},

In this work, we focus on dynamic, evolving social networks which exhibit numerous features that are also of interest to many researchers in non-social fields such as statistical physics, biology, applied mathematics, and computer science. We investigate how a specific research area (high-energy physics) changes over time, by building complex, interlinked citation, publication, and co-publication networks that evolve and expand constantly through the emergence of new papers and authors. Following an interdisciplinary approach, we perform a wide-ranging analysis of the high-energy physics dataset using techniques such as social networks centrality analysis, topological analysis, investigation of power law characteristics, time series analysis of publication and collaboration frequencies, as well as spatiotemporal analysis to discuss relationships among involved countries.},

  abstract = {The beautiful spiral waves of oxidation in the Belousov-Zhabotinskii reaction are the source of many interesting and important questions about periods structures in excitable media. It has long been known that these spirals are similar to involutes of circles, at least some distance from the center, but until now, no way has been known to determine the correct wavelength and frequency. In this paper, we show that the parameters of a spiral wave can be viwed s eigenvalues of a problem with unique solution. The critical ingredients of the theory are the effects of curvature on the propagation of wavefronts in two-dimensional media, and the dispersion of plane waves Our analytical results are shown to be in good agreement with experimental data for the Belousov-Zhabotinskii reagent.},

  abstract = {We study synchrony optimized networks. In particular, we focus on the Kuramoto model with nonidentical native frequencies on a random graph. In a first step, we generate synchrony optimized networks using a dynamic breeding algorithm, whereby an initial network is successively rewired toward increased synchronization. These networks are characterized by a large anti-correlation between neighbouring frequencies. In a second step, the central part of our paper, we show that synchrony optimized networks can be generated much more cost efficiently by minimization of an energy-like quantity E and subsequent random rewires to control the average path length. We demonstrate that synchrony optimized networks are characterized by a balance between two opposing structural properties: A large number of links between positive and negative frequencies of equal magnitude and a small average path length. Remarkably, these networks show the same synchronization behaviour as those networks generated by the dynamic rewiring process. Interestingly, synchrony-optimized network also exhibit significantly enhanced synchronization behaviour for weak coupling, below the onset of global synchronization, with linear growth of the order parameter with increasing coupling strength. We identify the underlying dynamical and topological structures, which give rise to this atypical local synchronization, and provide a simple analytical argument for its explanation.},

For the case of fast synapses, numerical and analytical calculations show that the network relaxes into a stationary state of high attention. The majority of the neurons has a membrane potential just below the threshold; as a consequence the network can react immediately &#8211; on the time scale of synaptic transmission- on external pulses. The neurons fire with a low rate and with a broad distribution of interspike intervals. Firing events of the total network are correlated over short time periods. The firing rate increases linearly with external stimuli. In the limit of infinitely large networks, the synaptic noise decreases to zero. Nevertheless, the distribution of interspike intervals remains broad.},

  abstract = {Vegetation in many semiarid regions is strikingly patterned, forming regular stripes on hillsides and irregular mosaics on flat ground. A simple model of plant and water dynamics based on ecologically realistic assumptions and with reasonable parameter values captures both of these types of patterns. The regular patterns result from a Turing-like instability; the irregular patterns arise when the ecological dynamics amplify slight small-scale topographic variability. Because of the close agreement between observations and these theoretical results, this system provides a clear example of how nonlinear mechanisms can be important in determining the spatial structure of plant communities.},

The so called 3rd order LLV model involves birth, death and reaction processes with 3rd order nonlinearities and feedbacks. At the mean field level this system exhibits conservative oscillations; the analytic form of the constant of motion is presented. The stochastic simulations show that the density oscillations disappear for sufficiently large lattices, while they are present locally, on small lattice windows. Introduction of mixing via long range migration in the two reacting species changes this picture. For small migration rates{\^A}�p, the behavior remains as with p = 0 and the system is divided into local asynchronous oscillators. As p increases the system passes through a phase transition and exhibits a weak disorder limit cycle through a supercritical Hopf-like bifurcation. The amplitude of the limit cycle depends on the rate p, on the range of migration r and on the system kinetic rates�k1, k2 and�k3.},

The network serves as a substrate for Lotka-Volterra dynamics with 3rd order nonlinearities. If the network includes only local nearest neighbour interactions, the system organizes into a number of local asynchronous oscillators. It is shown that (a) Introduction of all-to-all coupling in the network leads the system into global, center-type, conservative oscillations as dictated by the mean-field dynamics. (b) Introduction of reactive coupling to the network leads the system to intermittent oscillations where the trajectories stick for short times in bounded regions of space, with subsequent jumps between different bounded regions. (c) Introduction of diffusive coupling to the system does not alter the dynamics for small values of the diffusive coupling pdiff, while after a critical value pdiff c the system synchronizes into a limit cycle with specific frequency, deviating non-trivially from the mean-field center-type behaviour. The frequency of the limit cycle oscillations depends on the reaction rates and on the diffusion coupling. The amplitude � of the limit cycle depends on the control parameter pdiff.},

  abstract = {Traveling fronts and stationary localized patterns in bistable reaction-diffusion systems have been broadly studied for classical continuous media and regular lattices. Analogs of such non-equilibrium patterns are also possible in networks. Here, we consider traveling and stationary patterns in bistable one-component systems on random Erd\"os-R\'enyi, scale-free and hierarchical tree networks. As revealed through numerical simulations, traveling fronts exist in network-organized systems. They represent waves of transition from one stable state into another, spreading over the entire network. The fronts can furthermore be pinned, thus forming stationary structures. While pinning of fronts has previously been considered for chains of diffusively coupled bistable elements, the network architecture brings about significant differences. An important role is played by the degree (the number of connections) of a node. For regular trees with a fixed branching factor, the pinning conditions are analytically determined. For large Erd\"os-R\'enyi and scale-free networks, the mean-field theory for stationary patterns is constructed. },

common external feedback mirror and by nearest neighbor interactions. We seek to determine the conditions
 
under which all lasers of the array are in phase, whether in a steady, periodic, quasiperiodic, or chaotic regime,
 
in order to maximize the output far field intensity. We show that the delay may be a useful control parameter
 
to achieve in-phase synchronization. For the in-phase steady state, there is a competition between a delayinduced
 
Hopf bifurcation leading to an in-phase periodic regime and a delay-independent Hopf bifurcation
 
leading to an antiphased periodic regime. Both regimes are described analytically and secondary Hopf bifurcations
 
to quasiperiodic solutions are found. Close to the stable steady state, the array is described by a set of
 
Kuramoto equations for the phases of the fields. Above the first Hopf bifurcation, these equations are generalized
 
by the addition of second and third order time derivatives of the phases.},

  abstract = {We study the onset of sustained oscillations in a classical state-dependent delay (SDD) differential equation inspired by control theory. Owing to the large delays considered, the Hopf bifurcation is singular and the oscillations rapidly acquire a sawtooth profile past the instability threshold. Using asymptotic techniques, we explicitly capture the gradual change from nearly sinusoidal to sawtooth oscillations. The dependence of the delay on the solution can be either linear or nonlinear, with at least quadratic dependence. In the former case, an asymptotic connection is made with the Rayleigh oscillator. In the latter, van der Pol&#8217;s equation is derived for the small-amplitude oscillations. SDD differential equations are currently the subject of intense research in order to establish or amend general theorems valid for constant-delay differential equation, but explicit analytical construction of solutions are rare. This paper illustrates the use of singular perturbation techniques and the unusual way in which solvability conditions can arise for SDD problems with large delays.},

  abstract = {It is known that the FitzHugh-Nagumo equation possesses fast and slow travelling waves. Fast waves are perturbations of singular orbits consisting of two pieces of slow manifolds and connections between them, whereas slow waves are perturbations of homoclinic orbits of the unperturbed system. We unfold a degenerate point where the two types of singular orbits coalesce forming a heteroclinic orbit of the unperturbed system. Letcdenote the wave speed and[var epsilon]the singular perturbation parameter. We show that there exists aC2smooth curve of homoclinic orbits of the form (c, [var epsilon](c)) connecting the fast wave branch to the slow wave branch. Additionally we show that this curve has a unique non-degenerate maximum. Our analysis is based on a Shilnikov coordinates result, extending the Exchange Lemma of Jones and Kopell. We also prove the existence of inclination-flip points for the travelling wave equation thus providing the evidence of the existence ofn-homoclinic orbits (n-pulses for the FitzHugh-Nagumo equation) for arbitraryn.},

  abstract = {Synchronization of neuronal spiking in the brain is related to cognitive functions, such as perception, attention, and memory. It is therefore important to determine which properties of neurons influence their collective behavior in a network and to understand how. A prominent feature of many cortical neurons is spike frequency adaptation, which is caused by slow transmembrane currents. We investigated how these adaptation currents affect the synchronization tendency of coupled model neurons. Using the efficient adaptive exponential integrate-and-fire (aEIF) model and a biophysically detailed neuron model for validation, we found that increased adaptation currents promote synchronization of coupled excitatory neurons at lower spike frequencies, as long as the conduction delays between the neurons are negligible. Inhibitory neurons on the other hand synchronize in presence of conduction delays, with or without adaptation currents. Our results emphasize the utility of the aEIF model for computational studies of neuronal network dynamics. We conclude that adaptation currents provide a mechanism to generate low frequency oscillations in local populations of excitatory neurons, while faster rhythms seem to be caused by inhibition rather than excitation.},

The network consists of 2.5 million customers that have placed 810 million communications (phone calls and text messages) over a period of 6 months and for whom we have geographical home localization information. It is shown that the degree distribution in this network has a power-law degree distribution k &#8722; 5 and that the probability that two customers are connected by a link follows a gravity model, i.e. decreases as d &#8722; 2 , where d is the distance between the customers. We also consider the geographical extension of communication triangles and we show that communication triangles are not only composed of geographically adjacent nodes but that they may extend over large distances. This last property is not captured by the existing models of geographical networks and in a last section we propose a new model that reproduces the observed property. Our model, which is based on the migration and on the local adaptation of agents, is then studied analytically and the resulting predictions are confirmed by computer simulations.},

  abstract = {Abstract Neurovascular coupling, or functional hyperemia, refers to complex mechanisms of communication between neurons, astrocytes and cerebral vessels which form the neurovascular unit that spatially and temporally adjusts blood supply to the needs in energy and oxygen of activated neurons. Neurovascular coupling is so precise that it underlies neuroimaging techniques to map changes in neuronal activity. Therefore, understanding its basis is indispensable for the proper interpretation of imaging signals from functional magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography, routinely used in humans. Although neurovascular coupling mechanisms are not yet fully understood, considerable progress has been made over the last decade. In this review, we present recent knowledge from in vivo studies on the cortical cellular network involved in neurovascular coupling responses and the mediators implicated in these hemodynamic changes. Recent findings have emphasized the intricate interplay between both excitatory and inhibitory neurons in neurovascular coupling, together with an intermediary role of astrocytes, which are ideally positioned between neurons and microvessels. Finally, we describe latest findings on the alterations of neurovascular function encountered in neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer{\^a}s disease.},

  abstract = {Abstract The German trade network of pig holdings and related enterprises for the time period of 01 June 2006-31 December 2008 was analyzed. Available data comprised of the entire German trade information with about 121,287 pig premises and their links in the pork production chain (breeders to slaughter houses). During the study period, 330,000 trade connections between premises were recorded. Communities which are large scale structures comprising of premises which are in close trade contact with each other were detected by modularity maximization. Almost 97% of the pig holdings could be assigned to one of nine major communities. Contacts between communities are rare. Trade communities do not only form spatial clusters, but were also associated with specific regions within the territory of Germany. Communities are to some extent separated by [`]trade borders', which may impede disease spread. Interestingly, the trade borders often failed to match with administrative borders of the German federal states. This finding is important, because it illustrates the need for new strategies of cross-border disease management strategies.},

The patterns emerge owing to the interplay of a self-enhancing step in the reaction dynamics and a long-range inhibition by migration currents rather than by diffusion. Theoretical analysis revealed that this self-structuring of the electrode occurs in all electrochemical systems with an S-shapedI-&#966;DL characteristic in wide and well-accessible parameter ranges. This unusual pattern-forming instability in electrochemical systems has all the characteristics of the mechanism proposed by Turing in 1952 in the framework of an early theory of morphogenesis. Our finding might account for structure formation in certain biological systems that have gradients in the electric potential and may open new paths for fabricating patterned electrodes. },

  abstract = {Complex networks have attracted increasing attention from various fields of science and engineering today. Due to the finite speeds of transmission and spreading as well as traffic congestions, a signal or influence travelling through a complex network often is associated with time delays, and this is very common in biological and physical networks. In this paper, we introduce complex dynamical network models with coupling delays for both continuous- and discrete-time cases and then investigate their synchronization phenomena and criteria. Based on these new complex network models, we derive synchronization conditions for both delay-independent and delay-dependent asymptotical stabilities in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMI). We finally use a network with a fixed delay and a specific coupling scheme as an example to illustrate the theoretical results.},

In particular, the synchronizability of coupled oscillators can be enhanced in ER networks and scale-free networks under fast switching, while in stochastic small-world networks such enhancement is not significant.},

  abstract = {A method is outlined for estimating the the average number of synapses forming between cortical neurons as a function of their intercellular separation and the geometry of their dendritic and axonal arborization. Consideration is confined to the formation of local intracortical connections and to the case where the distribution of axonal and dendritic fibres has spherical symmetry. Parameters are deduced from quantitative anatomical studies in murine cortex. It is demonstrated that the majority of local connections forming within a given volume of isotropic cortex can be accounted for on the assumption that local connections between neurons form randomly.
 
From these computations the symmetry of connection between neurons, the likely position for synapse formation on the dendritic tree and the relative synaptic densities attributable to long-and short-range interaction between excitatory and inhibitory neural subsets is determined. Local intracortical couplings appear to be highly asymmetric, and account for about 3200 synapses forming on pyramidal and stellate cells.},

  abstract = {The human brain spontaneously generates neural oscillations with a large variability in frequency, amplitude, duration, and recurrence. Little, however, is known about the long-term spatiotemporal structure of the complex patterns of ongoing activity. A central unresolved issue is whether fluctuations in oscillatory activity reflect a memory of the dynamics of the system for more than a few seconds.We investigated the temporal correlations of network oscillations in the normal human brain at time scales ranging from a few seconds to several minutes. Ongoing activity during eyes-open and eyes-closed conditions was recorded with simultaneous magnetoencephalography and electroencephalography. Here we show that amplitude fluctuations of 10 and 20 Hz oscillations are correlated over thousands of oscillation cycles. Our analyses also indicated that these amplitude fluctuations obey power-law scaling behavior. The scaling exponents were highly invariant across subjects. We propose that the large variability, the long-range correlations, and the power-law scaling behavior of spontaneous oscillations find a unifying explanation within the theory of self-organized criticality, which offers a general mechanism for the emergence of correlations and complex dynamics in stochastic multiunit systems. The demonstrated scaling laws pose novel quantitative constraints on computational models of network oscillations. We argue that critical-state dynamics of spontaneous oscillations may lend neural networks capable of quick reorganization during processing demands.},

focus mainly on those general properties of such systems that are due to noise, and present several applications
 
of our {\"y}ndings in biophysics and lasers.
 
   As prototypes of excitable stochastic dynamics we consider the FitzHugh&#8211;Nagumo and the leaky integrate-
 
and-{\"y}re model, as well as cellular automata and phase models. In these systems, taken as individual units
 
or as networks of globally or locally coupled elements, we study various phenomena due to noise, such as
 
noise-induced oscillations, stochastic resonance, stochastic synchronization, noise-induced phase transitions and
 
noise-induced pulse and spiral dynamics.
 
   Our approach is based on stochastic di erential equations and their corresponding Fokker&#8211;Planck equations,
 
treated by both analytical calculations and/or numerical simulations. We calculate and/or measure the rate and
 
di usion coe cient of the excitation process, as well as spectral quantities like power spectra and degree of
 
coherence. Combined with a multiparametric bifurcation analysis of the corresponding cumulant equations,
 
these approaches provide a comprehensive picture of the multifaceted dynamical behaviour of noisy excitable
 
systems.

Sufficient conditions for both delay-independent and delay-dependent global exponential synchronization are obtained based on Lyapunov functional method. It is shown that, for some coupled chaotic systems and nonlinear coupling functions, if the coupling delay is less than a positive threshold, then the coupled network will be synchronized. On the other hand, with the increase of coupling delay, the synchronizability of the coupled network will be restrained, even eventually de-synchronized. Finally, an example is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed results.},

  abstract = {A quantitative description of a complex system is inherently limited by our ability to estimate the system&#8217;s internal state from experimentally accessible outputs. Although the simultaneous measurement of all internal variables, like all metabolite concentrations in a cell, offers a complete description of a system&#8217;s state, in practice experimental access is limited to only a subset of variables, or sensors. A system is called observable if we can reconstruct the system&#8217;s complete internal state from its outputs. Here, we adopt a graphical approach derived from the dynamical laws that govern a system to determine the sensors that are necessary to reconstruct the full internal state of a complex system. We apply this approach to biochemical reaction systems, finding that the identified sensors are not only necessary but also sufficient for observability. The developed approach can also identify the optimal sensors for target or partial observability, helping us reconstruct selected state variables from appropriately chosen outputs, a prerequisite for optimal biomarker design. Given the fundamental role observability plays in complex systems, these results offer avenues to systematically explore the dynamics of a wide range of natural, technological and socioeconomic systems.},

  abstract = {This paper studies dynamical behaviors and noise properties of semiconductor lasers with optical feedback from an interferometer, i.e., two external cavities. Bifurcation diagrams versus external-cavity length and reflectivity reveal the existence of stable regions for fixed states and limit cycles. The steady-state analysis for a laser diode with two external feedbacks is performed, which shows that oscillation modes are locked at minimum excess gain modes. Oscillation frequencies of limit cycles show discrete transitions with the variation of ratios between two external-cavity lengths and reflectivities. It is proposed that such a model might be applied to stabilization of the feedback-induced chaos in external-cavity semiconductor lasers since the stable region is quite robust for wide parameter ranges. Intensity and phase noises are examined and the results indicate that the low-frequency relative intensity noise level and the linewidth can be greatly improved when the laser output is a fixed state or a limit cycle},

locomotion. Coupled oscillator models have been successfully applied to model pattern generation in
 
numerous biological systems including jellyfish locomotion, but the previous jellyfish models have required
 
complicated oscillators or variation of coupling topology to produce gait variations. Here we show that a
 
simple model consisting of identical van der Pol oscillators with fixed coupling topology suffices to produce
 
dynamics corresponding to essential jellyfish gaits (co-ordinated bout swimming, hovering, and turning)
 
solely by uniform adjustment of coupling strengths. Thus, a simple coupled oscillator model succeeds in
 
producing a range of dynamic behaviour analogous to the essential neural dynamics for locomotion
 
control of a simple animal.},

The uncoupled dynamical behavior at each node is general, and can be chaotic or otherwise; the coupling configuration is also general, with the coupling matrix not assumed to be symmetric or irreducible. On the basis of geometrical analysis of the synchronization manifold, a new approach is proposed for investigating the stability of the synchronization manifold of coupled oscillators. In this way, criteria are obtained for both local and global synchronization. These criteria indicate that the left and right eigenvectors corresponding to eigenvalue zero of the coupling matrix play key roles in the stability analysis of the synchronization manifold. Furthermore, the roles of the uncoupled dynamical behavior on each node and the coupling configuration in the synchronization process are also studied.},

Since the impulsive effects discussed in this brief are regarded as disturbances, the impulses should not happen too frequently. The concept of average impulsive interval is used to formalize this phenomenon. By referring to an impulsive delay differential inequality, we investigate the globally exponential synchronization of linearly coupled NNs with impulsive disturbances. The derived sufficient condition is closely related with the time delay, impulse strengths, average impulsive interval, and coupling structure of the systems. The obtained criterion is given in terms of an algebraic inequality which is easy to be verified, and hence our result is valid for largescale systems. The results extend and improve upon earlier work. As a numerical example, a small-world network composing of impulsive coupled chaotic delayed NN nodes is given to illustrate our theoretical result.},

The number of coexisting stable states grows with an increase of the delay, and their frequencies quantize. We show that, while the number of synchronized solutions grows linearly with the delay and/or coupling, the set of the desynchronized solutions, i.e. those with different average frequencies of the individual oscillators, raises quadratically with increasing delay. For the synchronized states, we analyze the mutual arrangement of the basins of attraction, and conclude that the structure and size of the basins are apparently the same for each state. We discuss possible implications for desynchronizing brain stimulation techniques.

We show that the frequency of the oscillations at the bifurcation point remains close to the relaxation oscillation frequency of the solitary laser until the pump parameter is close to its effective threshold value. This part of our analysis adds substance to previous estimates of the frequency of the oscillations, which were guided by experiments. In the second part of our analysis, we show that, very close to threshold, the frequency exhibits a sharp transition from the relaxation oscillation frequency to a frequency proportional to the external cavity frequency (i.e., 2 pi/tau, where tau is the external round-trip time).}},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND:The integration of empirical data in computational frameworks designed to model the spread of infectious diseases poses a number of challenges that are becoming more pressing with the increasing availability of high-resolution information on human mobility and contacts. This deluge of data has the potential to revolutionize the computational efforts aimed at simulating scenarios, designing containment strategies, and evaluating outcomes. However, the integration of highly detailed data sources yields models that are less transparent and general in their applicability. Hence, given a specific disease model, it is crucial to assess which representations of the raw data work best to inform the model, striking a balance between simplicity and detail.METHODS:We consider high-resolution data on the face-to-face interactions of individuals in a pediatric hospital ward, obtained by using wearable proximity sensors. We simulate the spread of a disease in this community by using an SEIR model on top of different mathematical representations of the empirical contact patterns. At the most detailed level, we take into account all contacts between individuals and their exact timing and order. Then, we build a hierarchy of coarse-grained representations of the contact patterns that preserve only partially the temporal and structural information available in the data. We compare the dynamics of the SEIR model across these representations.RESULTS:We show that a contact matrix that only contains average contact durations between role classes fails to reproduce the size of the epidemic obtained using the high-resolution contact data and also fails to identify the most at-risk classes. We introduce a contact matrix of probability distributions that takes into account the heterogeneity of contact durations between (and within) classes of individuals, and we show that, in the case study presented, this representation yields a good approximation of the epidemic spreading properties obtained by using the high-resolution data.CONCLUSIONS:Our results mark a first step towards the definition of synopses of high-resolution dynamic contact networks, providing a compact representation of contact patterns that can correctly inform computational models designed to discover risk groups and evaluate containment policies. We show in a typical case of a structured population that this novel kind of representation can preserve in simulation quantitative features of the epidemics that are crucial for their study and management.},

  abstract = {{In this article, we will demonstrate a low local oscillator (LO) power K-band mixer based oil a tunneling diode technology. Due to its unique diode characteristics, no DC supply is needed, whereas all LO power as low as -2 dBm is required for nominal functionality. The energy-efficient MMIC prototype integrates a pair of heterojunction interband tunnel diodes and a 90 degrees coplanar broadband coupler. The prototype is optimized within the 19-26 GHz band. with an IF ranging from zero to 7 GHz. In addition, when compared with other mixers, it has the lowest LO power requirement with a conversion loss ranging from 6 to 10 dB, all input compression point of -3 dBm and an intercept 2nd and 3rd order intermodulation point of 22 and 12 dBm, respectively.

The carrier escape mechanisms are investigated via subpicosecond pump-probe measurements at room temperature, under reverse bias conditions. The optical pulses employed are degenerate in wavelength with the quantum dot ground state transition at 1.28 mu m. The absorption change recovers with characteristic times ranging from 62 ps (0 V) to similar to 700 fs (-10 V), showing a decrease of nearly two orders of magnitude. The authors show that at low applied fields, this recovery is attributed to thermionic emission while for higher applied fields, tunneling becomes the dominant mechanism.

The proposed laser cavities are in many ways nanoscale optical versions of micropatch antennas that are commonly used at microwave/RF frequencies. Surface plasmons are not only used for mode confinement but also for output beam shaping to realize single-lobe far-field radiation patterns with narrow beam waists from subwavelength size cavities. We identify the cavity modes with the largest quality factors and modal gain, and show that in the near-IR wavelength range (1.0-1.6 mum) cavity losses (including surface plasmon losses) can be compensated by the strong mode confinement in the gain region provided by the surface plasmons themselves and the required material threshold gain values can be smaller than 700 cm-1.},

The focus of the present study is to und erstand the mechanisms giving rise to the dynamics observed during absence epilepsy, one of the classical generalized syndromes. A systematic study of the data from a number of different subjects with absence epi lepsy demonstrates a wide variety of dynamical phenomena in the recorded EEG. In addition to the classical spike and wave activity, there may be polyspike and wave, wave spike or even no discernible spike&#8211;wave on set during seizure events. The model we introduce is able to capture all of these different phenomena and we describe the bifurcations giving rise to these different types of seizure activity. We argue that such a model may provide a useful clinical tool for classifying different subclasses of absence epilepsy.},

  abstract = {To what extent cortical pathways show significant weight differences and whether these differences are consistent across animals (thereby comprising robust connectivity profiles) is an important and unresolved neuroanatomical issue. Here we report a quantitative retrograde tracer analysis in the cynomolgus macaque monkey of the weight consistency of the afferents of cortical areas across brains via calculation of a weight index (fraction of labeled neurons, FLN). Injection in 8 cortical areas (3 occipital plus 5 in the other lobes) revealed a consistent pattern: small subcortical input (1.3% cumulative FLN), high local intrinsic connectivity (80% FLN), high-input form neighboring areas (15% cumulative FLN), and weak long-range corticocortical connectivity (3% cumulative FLN). Corticocortical FLN values of projections to areas V1, V2, and V4 showed heavy-tailed, lognormal distributions spanning 5 orders of magnitude that were consistent, demonstrating significant connectivity profiles. These results indicate that 1) connection weight heterogeneity plays an important role in determining cortical network specificity, 2) high investment in local projections highlights the importance of local processing, and 3) transmission of information across multiple hierarchy levels mainly involves pathways having low FLN values.},

  abstract = {We study an ensemble of neurons that are coupled through their time-delayed collective mean field. The individual neuron is modelled using a Hodgkin{\^a}��Huxley-type conductance model with parameters chosen such that the uncoupled neuron displays autonomous subthreshold oscillations of the membrane potential. We find that the ensemble generates a rich variety of oscillatory activities that are mainly controlled by two time scales: the natural period of oscillation at the single neuron level and the delay time of the global coupling. When the neuronal oscillations are synchronized, they can be either in-phase or out-of-phase. The phase-shifted activity is interpreted as the result of a phase-flip bifurcation, also occurring in a set of globally delay-coupled limit cycle oscillators. At the bifurcation point, there is a transition from in-phase to out-of-phase (or vice versa) synchronized oscillations, which is accompanied by an abrupt change in the common oscillation frequency. This phase-flip bifurcation was recently investigated in two mutually delay-coupled oscillators and can play a role in the mechanisms by which the neurons switch among different firing patterns.},

  abstract = {Collective dynamics result from interactions among noisy dynamical components. Examples include heartbeats, circadian rhythms and various pattern formations. Because of noise in each component, collective dynamics inevitably involve fluctuations, which may crucially affect the functioning of the system. However, the relation between the fluctuations in isolated individual components and those in collective dynamics is not clear. Here, we study a linear dynamical system of networked components subjected to independent Gaussian noise and analytically show that the connectivity of networks determines the intensity of fluctuations in the collective dynamics. Remarkably, in general directed networks including scale-free networks, the fluctuations decrease more slowly with system size than the standard law stated by the central limit theorem. They even remain finite for a large system size when global directionality of the network exists. Moreover, such non-trivial behavior appears even in undirected networks when nonlinear dynamical systems are considered. We demonstrate it with a coupled oscillator system.},

How can a single lipid in a fluid bilayer regulate so many distinct physiological processes? Spatial organization might be the key to this. Recent studies suggest that membrane proteins concentrate PIP2 and, in response to local increases in intracellular calcium concentration, release it to interact with other biologically important molecules.},

  abstract = {Subliminal stimuli can be deeply processed and activate similar brain areas as consciously perceived stimuli. This raises the question which signatures of neural activity critically differentiate conscious from unconscious processing. Transient synchronization of neural activity has been proposed as a neural correlate of conscious perception. Here we test this proposal by comparing the electrophysiological responses related to the processing of visible and invisible words in a delayed matching to sample task. Both perceived and nonperceived words caused a similar increase of local (gamma) oscillations in the EEG, but only perceived words induced a transient long-distance synchronization of gamma oscillations across widely separated regions of the brain. After this transient period of temporal coordination, the electrographic signatures of conscious and unconscious processes continue to diverge. Only words reported as perceived induced (1) enhanced theta oscillations over frontal regions during the maintenance interval, (2) an increase of the P300 component of the event-related potential, and (3) an increase in power and phase synchrony of gamma oscillations before the anticipated presentation of the test word. We propose that the critical process mediating the access to conscious perception is the early transient global increase of phase synchrony of oscillatory activity in the gamma frequency range.},

  abstract = {The Mackey-Glass and Ikeda delay-differential equations (DDEs) are models of feedback systems in which attractor dimension is proportional to the delay. Power spectra from these models are investigated analytically and numerically. As the delay increases much beyond the system response time, an exponentially decaying spectrum with a near-periodic superimposed modulation appears. It is shown that each peak in this modulation is associated with a mode of oscillation predicted by linear stability analysis around the fixed point. The number of such modes within a characteristic autocorrelation time of the solution agrees with the Lyapunov dimension of the attractor. The disappearance of this modulation at higher delay values is also explained. The decay rate of the spectrum in the mid-to-high frequency range is found to agree with the sum of the positive Lyapunov exponents, i.e. with the metric entropy. Realistic models with a distribution of delays display similar spectra as their memory kernel narrows into a delta-function. For very large delay, the DDE approaches an infinite-dimensional continuous-time difference equation (CTDE), with each point on a delay interval evolving independently and according to a chaotic discrete-time map. CTDE spectra, which have many features of finite-delay DDE spectra, can be computed analytically if the spectrum of this map is known. For constant initial functions, they have a 1/f(2) form at low frequencies. Our analysis suggests that the spectrum of the chaotic map is at the origin of the peak shapes in DDE spectra at low frequency. Our findings highlight the relevance of the linear properties of DDEs to the characterization of their nonlinear properties.},

  abstract = {Neuronal activity evokes localized changes in blood flow. Although this response, termed neurovascular coupling, is widely used to monitor human brain function and diagnose pathology, the cellular mechanisms that mediate the response remain unclear. We investigated the contribution of glial cells to neurovascular coupling in the acutely isolated mammalian retina. We found that light stimulation and glial cell stimulation can both evoke dilation or constriction of arterioles. Light-evoked and glial-evoked vasodilations were blocked by inhibitors of cytochrome P450 epoxygenase, the synthetic enzyme for epoxyeicosatrienoic acids. Vasoconstrictions, in contrast, were blocked by an inhibitor of {omega}-hydroxylase, which synthesizes 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid. Nitric oxide influenced whether vasodilations or vasoconstrictions were produced in response to light and glial stimulation. Light-evoked vasoactivity was blocked when neuron-to-glia signaling was interrupted by a purinergic antagonist. These results indicate that glial cells contribute to neurovascular coupling and suggest that regulation of blood flow may involve both vasodilating and vasoconstricting components.},

The performance of the 80 Gb/s wavelength converter measured in terms of the bit-error ratio demonstrated here is the highest reported up to now for quantum-dot semiconductor optical amplifiers. The typical fast gain dynamics manifests itself in open eye diagrams of the converted signal. The slow phase dynamics of the carrier reservoir however induces severe patterning and requires compensation. Adaptation of the free-spectral range of the delay interferometer is necessary in order to mitigate these phase effects and to achieve error-free wavelength conversion.},

  abstract = {We consider the synchronization problem of an arbitrary number of coupled nonlinear oscillators with delays in the interconnections. The network topology is described by a directed graph. Unlike the conventional approach of deriving directly sufficient synchronization conditions, the approach of the paper starts from an exact stability analysis in a (gain, delay) parameter space of a synchronized equilibrium and extracts insights from an analysis of its bifurcations and from the corresponding emerging behavior. Instrumental to this analysis a factorization of the characteristic equation is employed that not only facilitates the analysis and reduces computational cost but also allows to determine the precise role of the individual agents and the topology of the network in the (in)stability mechanisms. The study provides an algorithm to perform a stability and bifurcation analysis of synchronized equilibria. Furthermore, it reveals fundamental limitations to synchronization and it explains under which conditions on the topology of the network and on the characteristics of the coupling the systems are expected to synchronize. In the second part of the paper the results are applied to coupled Lorenz systems. The main results show that for sufficiently large coupling gains, delay-coupled Lorenz systems exhibit a generic behavior that does not depend on the number of systems and the topology of the network, as long as some basic assumptions are satisfied, including the strong connectivity of the graph. Here the linearized stability analysis is strengthened by a nonlinear stability analysis which confirms the predictions based on the linearized stability and bifurcation analysis. This illustrates the usefulness of the exact linearized analysis in a situation where a direct nonlinear stability analysis is not possible or where it yields conservative conditions from which it is hard to get qualitative insights in the synchronization mechanisms and their scaling properties. In the examples several network topologies are considered.},

ribbon, the average temperature of which is kept by electrical heating at a preset value, when the catalytic surface
 
undergoes slow activation-deactivation. The control of the average temperature introduces an integral constraint that
 
generates patterns that are not observed in its absence. This one-dimensional system exhibits (in addition to a chaotic
 
behavior) four basic motions: unidirectional pulses, back-and-forth pulses, antiphase oscillation, and a source point from
 
which two pulses emanate and move in opposite directions. Other motions we observed are combinations and transitions
 
among these four. Several of the motions have already been observed experimentally. At some transitions, spatial
 
structures appear to change discontinuously and without hysteresis, suggesting global bifurcations.},

This observation is used to motivate an investigation of a simp le switch-like controller for postural sway in which corrective movements are made only when the vertical displacement angle exceeds a certain threshold. This mechanism is shown to be consistent with the experime ntally observed variations in the two-point correlation for human postural sway. Analysis of first-passage times for this model suggests that this control strategy may slow escape by taking advantage of two intri nsic properties of a stochastic unstable first-order delay differential equation: (i) time delay and (ii) the possibility that the dynamics can be &#8216;temporarily confined&#8217; near the origin.},

The model consists of a population of identical integrate-and-fire oscillators. The coupling between oscillators is pulsatile: when a given oscillator fires, it pulls the others up by a fixed amount, or brings them to the firing threshold, whichever is less.The main result is that for almost all initial conditions, the population evolves to a state in which all the oscillators are firing synchronously. The relationship between the model and real communities of biological oscillators is discussed; examples include populations of synchronously flashing fireflies, crickets that chirp in unison, electrically synchronous pacemaker cells, and groups of women whose menstrual cycles become mutually synchronized.

The three systems analysed (Ythan estuary web, Silwood web and the Little Rock lake web) have different levels of taxonomic resolution, but all of them involve high clustering and short path lengths (near two degrees of separation) between species. Additionally, the distribution of connections P(k) which is skewed in all the webs analysed shows long tails indicative of power-law scaling. These features suggest that communities might be self-organized in a non-random fashion that might have important consequences in their resistance to perturbations (such as species removal). The consequences for ecological theory are outlined. Copyright 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

Phase transitions appear as macroscopic bifurcations.

A transfer matrix formalism including a self-consistent potential \~{A}� la Edwards is introduced. In the extended region of the spectrum, an effective medium calculation provides the density of states and pseudo relations of dispersion for the eigenmodes in close agreement with the simulations. Localization effects, which are due to connectivity fluctuations of the sites are shown to be quantitatively described by the single defect approximation recently introduced for random graphs.},

A particular focus are diffusion-induced instabilities, i.e., Turing instabilities. We present various theorems that make it possible to determine analytically the stability properties of networks with arbitrary topologies and general monostable dynamics of the individual cells. This work aims in particular to determine those topologies that will give rise to localized stationary patterns. Specific examples focus on well-stirred chemical reactors. The reactors are coupled by diffusion-like mass transfer, and the kinetics is given by the Lengyel{\^a}��Epstein model, a two-variable scheme for the chlorine dioxide{\^a}��iodine{\^a}��malonic acid reaction.},

The phase dynamics is slower and is affected by thermal redistribution of carriers within the dot.

We show that, in the optimum regime, synchronizability is solely determined by the average degree and does not depend on the system size and the details of the degree distribution. In scale-free networks, where the average degree may increase with heterogeneity, synchronizability is drastically enhanced and may become positively correlated with heterogeneity, while the overall cost involved in the network coupling is significantly reduced as compared to the case of unweighted coupling.},

activity in thalamus and neocortex across various levels of anesthesia and stimulation conditions. We
 
also review computational models of propagating waves in networks of thalamic cells, cortical cells
 
and of the thalamocortical system. Some discrepancies between experiments can be explained by the
 
{\^a}��{\^a}��network state{\^a}��{\^a}��, which differs vastly between anesthetized and awake conditions. We introduce a network
 
model displaying different states and investigate their effect on the spatial structure of self-sustained
 
and externally driven activity. This approach is a step towards understanding how the
 
intrinsically-generated ongoing activity of the network affects its ability to process and propagate extrinsic
 
input.},

  abstract = {Spatio-temporal, geo-referenced datasets are growing rapidly, and will be more in the near future, due to both technological and social/commercial reasons. From the data mining viewpoint, spatio-temporal trajectory data introduce new dimensions and, correspondingly, novel issues in performing the analysis tasks. In this paper, we consider the clustering problem applied to the trajectory data domain. In particular, we propose an adaptation of a density-based clustering algorithm to trajectory data based on a simple notion of distance between trajectories. Then, a set of experiments on synthesized data is performed in order to test the algorithm and to compare it with other standard clustering approaches. Finally, a new approach to the trajectory clustering problem, called temporal focussing , is sketched, having the aim of exploiting the intrinsic semantics of the temporal dimension to improve the quality of trajectory clustering.},

  abstract = {The emergence of synchronization is a phenomenon that is ubiquitous in a wide variety of natural systems. Such behavior is also often robust: systems subject to large stochastic fluctuations and which possess a range of internal time scales are capable of exhibiting sustained correlated dynamics. Here we study model chemical reactions and genetic networks that have stochastic oscillatory dynamics, and discuss microscopic mechanisms through which two or more such distinct stochastic processes can be coupled so as to result in the phase synchronization of their dynamical variables. We also consider the effect of time delay in the interaction and show that for suitable choices of the delay parameter, in-phase or antiphase synchronization can occur.},

  abstract = {Semiconductor lasers subject to delayed optical feedback have recently shown great potential in solving computationally hard tasks. By optically implementing a neuro-inspired computational scheme, called reservoir computing, based on the transient response to optical data injection, high processing speeds have been demonstrated. While previous efforts have focused on signal bandwidths limited by the semiconductor laser{\^a}��s relaxation oscillation frequency, we demonstrate numerically that the much faster phase response makes significantly higher processing speeds attainable. Moreover, this also leads to shorter external cavity lengths facilitating future on-chip implementations. We numerically benchmark our system on a chaotic time-series prediction task considering two different feedback configurations. The results show that a prediction error below 4% can be obtained when the data is processed at 0.25 GSamples/s. In addition, our insight into the phase dynamics of optical injection in a semiconductor laser also provides a clear understanding of the system performance at different pump current levels, even below solitary laser threshold. Considering spontaneous emission noise and noise in the readout layer, we obtain good prediction performance at fast processing speeds for realistic values of the noise strength.},

We then investigate the dependence of the bandwidth and the energy per bit on the quality factor and the normalized optical volume. We find out that the conditions for the energy per bit less than 50 fJ/bit and 10 fJ/bit are the normalized optical modal volume less than 20 and 5, respectively. In addition, with a uniform quantum dot size in a nanocavity, quantum-dot metal-cavity nanolasers exhibit the largest bandwidth among three types of active materials, and a low energy per bit. With their insensitivity to temperature, quantum-dot metal-cavity nanolasers are favorable for future high speed light sources.},

from a codimension-2 Turing-wave bifurcation (TWB). DPDs are found within that region in a substantial
 
distance from the TWB. We investigated the dynamics of single interfaces between Turing and wave patterns.
 
It is found that DPDs exist due to a locking of the interface velocities, which is imposed by the absence of
 
space-time defects near these interfaces.},

We use a Born-Markov secular quantum master equation for the system. The obtained currents show signatures of the qubit.

In the Coulomb diamonds, it is also possible to stabilize pure entangled states of the transport double quantum dots.},

  abstract = {Neural delays are a general property of computations carried out by neural circuits. Delays are a natural consequence of temporal summation and coding used by the nervous system to integrate informati on from multiple resources. For adaptive behaviour, however, these delays must be compensated. In order to sense and interact with moving objects, for example, the visual system must predict the future position o f the object to compensate for delays. In this paper, we address two critical questions concerning the implementation of the compensation mechanisms in the brain, namely, where does compensation occur and how is it realized. We present evidence showing that compensation can happen in both the motor and sensory systems, and that compensation using &#8216;diagonal neural pathways&#8217; is a suitable strategy for implementing compensa tion in the visual system. In this strategy, neural signals in the early stage of information processing are sent to the future cortical positions that correspond to the distance the object will travel in the per iod of transmission delay. We propose a computational model to elucidate this using the retinal visual information pathway.},

  abstract = {One of the fundamental questions for self-organization in pattern formation is how spatial periodic structure is spontaneously formed starting from a localized fluctuation. It is known in dissipative systems that splitting dynamics is one of the driving forces to create many particle-like patterns from a single seed. On the way to final state there occur many collisions among them and its scattering manner is crucial to predict whether periodic structure is realized or not. We focus on the colliding dynamics of traveling spots arising in a three-component system and study how the transition of scattering dynamics is brought about. It has been clarified that hidden unstable patterns called &#8220;scattors&#8221; and their stable and unstable manifolds direct the traffic flow of orbits before and after collisions. The collision process in general can be decomposed into several steps and each step is controlled by such a scattor, in other words, a network among scattors forms the backbone for scattering dynamics. A variety of input-output relations comes from the complexity of the network as well as high Morse indices of the scattor. The change of transition manners is caused by the switching of the network from one structure to another, and such a change is caused by the singularities of scattors. We illustrate a typical example of the change of transition caused by the destabilization of the scattor. A new instability of the scattor brings a new destination for the orbit resulting in a new input-output relation, for instance, Hopf instability for the scattor of peanut type brings an annihilation.},

We first develop an extension of the well-known master stability framework to the case of non-diagonalizable Laplacian matrices. We then show that the solution sets of the two optimization problems coincide and are simultaneously characterized by a simple condition on the Laplacian eigenvalues. Among the optimal networks, we identify a subclass of hierarchical networks, characterized by the absence of feedback loops and the normalization of inputs. We show that most optimal networks are directed and non-diagonalizable, necessitating the extension of the framework. We also show how oriented spanning trees can be used to explicitly and systematically construct optimal networks under network topological constraints. Our results may provide insights into the evolutionary origin of structures in complex networks for which synchronization plays a significant role.},

  abstract = {THE determination of the adsorption geometry of molecules and molecular fragments on single-crystal metal surfaces is central to our understanding of heterogeneous catalysis. Adsorbate structures can be determined precisely by techniques such as low-energy electron diffraction and photoelectron diffraction. Such methods suffer, however, from the rather inefficient approach to data analysis: the diffracted intensities are compared with simulated data for a trial structure, which is successively modified by trial and error until good agreement is achieved. Following a suggestion by Barton that a photoelectron angular distribution may be regarded as a photoelectron hologram1,2, attention has been focused recently on simpler methods for adsorbate structure determination which give real-space information directly3&#8211;7. We demonstrate here a direct method for determining both the adsorption site and the adsorbate&#8211;substrate separation from photoelectron diffraction data8. We illustrate the method using two adsorption systems: CO on Cu(110) and OCH3 on Cu(111). Our results are consistent with those determined for the same systems by a related method7, which requires a considerably larger data set and provides bond lengths at lower precision. For adsorbates on simple surfaces, we therefore propose that our approach provides an accurate and easily implemented method for structure determination.},

The student&#8217;s needs are modeled as constraints on the schedule according to which educational material and review are spaced over time. Our results include algorithms to construct schedules that adhere to various spacing constraints, and bounds on the rate at which new material can be introduced under these schedules.},

  abstract = {Neurons in the cerebral cortex are organized into anatomical columns, with ensembles of cells arranged from the surface to the white matter. Within a column, neurons often share functional properties, such as selectivity for stimulus orientation; columns with distinct properties, such as different preferred orientations, tile the cortical surface in orderly patterns. This functional architecture was discovered with the relatively sparse sampling of microelectrode recordings. Optical imaging of membrane voltage or metabolic activity elucidated the overall geometry of functional maps, but is averaged over many cells (resolution >100 microm). Consequently, the purity of functional domains and the precision of the borders between them could not be resolved. Here, we labelled thousands of neurons of the visual cortex with a calcium-sensitive indicator in vivo. We then imaged the activity of neuronal populations at single-cell resolution with two-photon microscopy up to a depth of 400 microm. In rat primary visual cortex, neurons had robust orientation selectivity but there was no discernible local structure; neighbouring neurons often responded to different orientations. In area 18 of cat visual cortex, functional maps were organized at a fine scale. Neurons with opposite preferences for stimulus direction were segregated with extraordinary spatial precision in three dimensions, with columnar borders one to two cells wide. These results indicate that cortical maps can be built with single-cell precision.

  abstract = { In the visual cortex of higher mammals, neurons are arranged across the cortical surface in an orderly map of preferred stimulus orientations. This map contains 'orientation pinwheels', structures that are arranged like the spokes of a wheel such that orientation changes continuously around a centre. Conventional optical imaging first demonstrated these pinwheels, but the technique lacked the spatial resolution to determine the response properties and arrangement of cells near pinwheel centres. Electrophysiological recordings later demonstrated sharply selective neurons near pinwheel centres, but it remained unclear whether they were arranged randomly or in an orderly fashion. Here we use two-photon calcium imaging in vivo to determine the microstructure of pinwheel centres in cat visual cortex with single-cell resolution. We find that pinwheel centres are highly ordered: neurons selective to different orientations are clearly segregated even in the very centre. Thus, pinwheel centres truly represent singularities in the cortical map. This highly ordered arrangement at the level of single cells suggests great precision in the development of cortical circuits underlying orientation selectivity.},

  abstract = {Recently, multisite delayed feedback stimulation was proposed as a novel method for mild and effective deep brain stimulation in neurological diseases characterized by pathological cerebral synchronization. To develop the mathematical background of this technique we propose a continuous medium model of globally coupled phase oscillators in the form of a delayed integro-differential equation. This model provides a convenient description of the spatial phase patterns depending on the stimulation topology. We describe physically relevant phase-locked solutions and analyze their linear stability. Considering different spatial stimulation profiles as well as delays and polarities, we demonstrate that multisite delayed feedback is a robust, soft and effective method for the control of spatio-temporal synchronization patterns. Our results can be used for the optimization of parameters in applications of multisite delayed feedback stimulation to the therapy of neurological diseases with pathological synchronization and the therapy of defective central pattern generators.},

For such patterns we formulate a general bifurcation analysis scheme based on a hierarchy of continuum limit equations. This provides the possibility of classifying known coherence{\^a}incoherence patterns and of suggesting directions for the search for new ones.},

It is possible to analyze such huge collection of data to look for critical situation on the traffic flow. The offline analysis of traffic congestions represents a challenging task for urban mobility managers. This kind of analysis can be used by the traffic planner to predict future areas of traffic congestions, or to improve the accessibility to specific attraction points in a city.Many traffic systems adopt ad-hoc sensors like cameras, induction loops, magnetic sensors to monitor the status of the traffic flows: these systems are very expensive for installation and maintenance, and they are restricted to the local monitoring of the road arcs where they are installed. On the contrary, the use of GPS data to check the traffic conditions requires low installation costs (a part for the installation on the vehicle) and it enables to virtually monitoring the entire road network.},

Here we examine the communication patterns of millions of mobile phone users, allowing us to simultaneously study the local and the global structure of a society-wide communication network. We observe a coupling between interaction strengths and the network's local structure, with the counterintuitive consequence that social networks are robust to the removal of the strong ties but fall apart after a phase transition if the weak ties are removed. We show that this coupling significantly slows the diffusion process, resulting in dynamic trapping of information in communities and find that, when it comes to information diffusion, weak and strong ties are both simultaneously ineffective.},

  abstract = {Rotating spiral waves organize excitation in various biological, physical, and chemical systems. They underpin a variety of important phenomena, such as cardiac arrhythmias, morphogenesis processes, and spatial patterns in chemical reactions. Important insights into spiral wave dynamics have been obtained from theoretical studies of the reaction&#8211;diffusion (RD) partial differential equations. However, most of these studies have ignored the fact that spiral wave rotation is often accompanied by substantial deformations of the medium. Here, we show that joint consideration of the RD equations with the equations of continuum mechanics for tissue deformations (RD&#8211;mechanics systems), yield important effects on spiral wave dynamics. We show that deformation can induce the breakup of spiral waves into complex spatiotemporal patterns. We also show that mechanics leads to spiral wave drift throughout the medium approaching dynamical attractors, which are determined by the parameters of the model and the size of the medium. We study mechanisms of these effects and discuss their applicability to the theory of cardiac arrhythmias. Overall, we demonstrate the importance of RD&#8211;mechanics systems for mathematics applied to life sciences.},

implementations are possible. Here we report an optoelectronic implementation of reservoir computing
 
based on a recently proposed architecture consisting of a single non linear node and a delay line. Our
 
implementation is sufficiently fast for real time information processing. We illustrate its performance on
 
tasks of practical importance such as nonlinear channel equalization and speech recognition, and obtain
 
results comparable to state of the art digital implementations.},

A reduced-order vortex model describes the interaction between the shear layer and wake dynamics and guides a path to an efficient feedback control design. The derived feedback controller desynchronizes shear-layer and wake dynamics, thus postponing vortex formation. This actuation is tested in a wind tunnel. The Reynolds number based on the height of the body ranges from 23000 to 70000. We achieve a 40% increase in base pressure associated with a 15% drag reduction employing zero-net-mass-flux actuation. Our controller outperforms other approaches based on open-loop forcing and extremum-seeking feedback strategies in terms of drag reduction, adaptivity, and the required actuation energy.},

The effects of defects on the interaction of two solitons are considered in lasers with frequency-selective feedback both theoretically and experimentally.

In both theory and experiment the locking behavior is well described by the Adler model for the synchronization of coupled oscillators. },

  abstract = {As important as the intrinsic properties of an individual nervous cell stands the network of neurons in which it is embedded and by virtue of which it acquires great part of its responsiveness and functionality. In this study we have explored how the topological properties and conduction delays of several classes of neural networks affect the capacity of their constituent cells to establish well-defined temporal relations among firing of their action potentials. This ability of a population of neurons to produce and maintain a millisecond-precise coordinated firing (either evoked by external stimuli or internally generated) is central to neural codes exploiting precise spike timing for the representation and communication of information. Our results, based on extensive simulations of conductance-based type of neurons in an oscillatory regime, indicate that only certain topologies of networks allow for a coordinated firing at a local and long-range scale simultaneously. Besides network architecture, axonal conduction delays are also observed to be another important factor in the generation of coherent spiking. We report that such communication latencies not only set the phase difference between the oscillatory activity of remote neural populations but determine whether the interconnected cells can set in any coherent firing at all. In this context, we have also investigated how the balance between the network synchronizing effects and the dispersive drift caused by inhomogeneities in natural firing frequencies across neurons is resolved. Finally, we show that the observed roles of conduction delays and frequency dispersion are not particular to canonical networks but experimentally measured anatomical networks such as the macaque cortical network can display the same type of behavior.},

For the case of diffusive oscillators, we formulate the equations relating the topology of the network and the phases and frequencies of the oscillators (functional response). We solve them exactly in directed networks for the case of perfect synchronization. We also compare the reliability of the solution of the linear system for non-linear couplings. Taking advantage of the form of the solution, we propose a frequency adaptation rule to achieve perfect synchronization. We also propose a mean-field theory for uncorrelated random networks that proves to be pretty accurate to predict phase synchronization in real topologies, as for example, the Caenorhabditis elegans or the autonomous systems connectivity.},

  abstract = {{Hopf bifurcation theory for an oscillator subject to a weak feedback but a large delay is investigated for a specific laser system. The problem is motivated by semiconductor laser instabilities which are initiated by undesirable optical feedbacks. Most of these instabilities are starting from a single Hopf bifurcation. Because of the large delay, a delayed amplitude appears in the slow time bifurcation equation which generates new bifurcations to periodic and quasi-periodic states. We determine analytical expressions for all branches of periodic solutions and show the emergence of secondary bifurcation points from double Hopf bifurcation points. We study numerically different cases of bistability between steady, periodic, and quasi-periodic regimes. Finally, the validity of the Hopf bifurcation approximation is investigated numerically by comparing the bifurcation diagrams of the original laser equations and the slow time amplitude equation.}},

  abstract = {{For semiconductor lasers subject to a delayed optical feedback, branches of steady states sequentially appear as the feedback rate is increased. But branches of time-periodic solutions are connecting pairs of steady states and provide bridges between stable and unstable modes. All bridges experience a change of stability through a torus bifurcation point. Close to the bifurcation point, the torus remains localized Dear a specific fixed point in phase space. As the feedback rate increases, the torus envelope suddenly unfolds and its trajectory visits two or more unstable fixed points, anticipating the rich dynamics observed at larger feedback rates.}},

  abstract = {Organisms are equipped with regulatory systems that display a variety of dynamical behavior ranging from simple stable steady states, to switching and multistability, to oscillations. Earlier work has shown that oscillations in protein concentrations or gene expression levels are related to the presence of at least one negative feedback loop in the regulatory network. Here, we study the dynamics of a very general class of negative feedback loops. Our main result is that, when a single negative feedback loop dominates the dynamical behavior, the sequence of maxima and minima of the concentrations exhibit a pattern that uniquely identifies the interactions of the loop. This allows us to devise an algorithm to (i) test whether observed oscillating time series are consistent with a single underlying negative feedback loop, and if so, (ii) reconstruct the precise structure of the loop, i.e., the activating/repressing nature of each interaction. This method applies even when some variables are missing from the data set, or if the time series shows transients, like damped oscillations. We illustrate the relevance and the limits of validity of our method with three examples: p53-Mdm2 oscillations, circadian gene expression in cyanobacteria, and cyclic binding of cofactors at the estrogen-sensitive pS2 promoter.},

The ENs were designed to reproduce the observed membrane voltage oscillations of isolated biological neurons from the stomatogastric ganglion of the California spiny lobster Panulirus interruptus. The ENs are simple analog circuits which integrate four-dimensional differential equations representing fast and slow subcellular mechanisms that produce the characteristic regular/chaotic spiking&#8211;bursting behavior of these cells. In this paper we study their dynamical behavior as we couple them in the same configurations as we have done for their counterpart biological neurons. The interconnections we use for these neural oscillators are both direct electrical connections and excitatory and inhibitory chemical connections: each realized by analog circuitry and suggested by biological examples. We provide here quantitative evidence that the ENs and the biological neurons behave similarly when coupled in the same manner. They each display well defined bifurcations in their mutual synchronization and regularization. We report briefly on an experiment on coupled biological neurons and four-dimensional ENs, which provides further ground for testing the validity of our numerical and electronic models of individual neural behavior. Our experiments as a whole present interesting new examples of regularization and synchronization in coupled nonlinear oscillators.},

In order to precisely tune the emission wavelength of QDs, the double cap growth procedure is used. Laser emission on the ground states is obtained under optical pumping at room temperature. On equivalent structures doped for electrical injection, laser emission is also observed at low temperatures up to 200 K. The difference between the optical and electrical pumping is ascribed to low carrier injection efficiency due to the presence of a 3 nm InP hole blocking barrier at each quantum dot layer which is inherent to the double cap growth procedure. Room temperature laser emission has been reached when the InP first cap layer is substituted by a quaternary GaInAsP (1.18 &#956;m gap) layer in the double cap growth procedure. The threshold current density of the new structure with QD capped only by quaternary is as low as 840 A cm&#8722;2 at room temperature.},

  abstract = {For many years it was believed that an unstable periodic orbit with an odd number of real Floquet multipliers greater than unity cannot be stabilized by the time-delayed feedback control mechanism of Pyragas. A recent paper by Fiedler et al. Phys. Rev. Lett. 98, 114101 (2007) uses the normal form of a subcritical Hopf bifurcation to give a counterexample to this theorem. Using the Lorenz equations as an example, we demonstrate that the stabilization mechanism identified by Fiedler et al. for the Hopf normal form can also apply to unstable periodic orbits created by subcritical Hopf bifurcations in higher-dimensional dynamical systems. Our analysis focuses on a particular codimension-two bifurcation that captures the stabilization mechanism in the Hopf normal form example, and we show that the same codimension-two bifurcation is present in the Lorenz equations with appropriately chosen Pyragas-type time-delayed feedback. This example suggests a possible strategy for choosing the feedback gain matrix in Pyragas control of unstable periodic orbits that arise from a subcritical Hopf bifurcation of a stable equilibrium.

We investigate situations when latency times associated with the generation and injection of the control force cannot be ignored. We derive a theoretical explanation for experimentally observed, nontrivial features of the domain of control, e.g., gaps, maximum latency times. The explanation is done in the background of Floquet theory and we take both the unstable eigenmode and a single stable eigenmode into account.
 

 
The presence of high frequency oscillations in the  eedback signal can reduce the effectiveness of the control scheme. We show that this limitation can be eliminated by low-pass filtering the feedback signal before the generation of the control force. Thus, a
 
filtered time-delayed feedback method leads to a separation of the timescales present in the system. The effects of a low-pass filter included in the control loop are
 
discussed in the frequency regime using transfer functions.

In most of the theoretical analysis, this control method is considered in the realization of diagonal coupling, i.e., the control force applied to the i-th component of the system is a function of exclusively the same component. Although diagonal coupling is suitable for a theoretical investigation, it is often not feasible for an experiment. Therefore we consider the more general case where control is effected by a nondiagonal coupling matrix. Specifically, we investigate the time-delayed feedback scheme for a rotational coupling matrix parametrized by a variable phase. We present an analysis of the domain of control for simple time-delay autosynchronization (TDAS) as well as for multiple time extended feedback (ETDAS). We demonstrate the application to optical systems \cite{TRO06,SCH06a} where the optical phase is an additional degree of freedom.},

  abstract = {We present analysis of time-delayed feedback control used to stabilize an unstable steady state of a neutral delay differential equation. A delay differential equation is called neutral if it contains a time delay in the highest derivative involved. This type of equations arises in numerous physical and engineering application, for
 
example, hybrid testing, chaotic oscillations in transmission lines and torsional waves of a drill string. Due to the original time delay present in the system, its steady states may become unstable through a Hopf bifurcation, and adding a time-delayed feedback control will stabilize the system again.
 

 
Stability of the controlled system is addressed by studying the eigenvalue spectrum of a corresponding characteristic equation with two time delays. An analytic expression for the stabilizing control strength is derived in terms of original system parameters and the time delay of the control. Theoretical and numerical results show that the interplay between the control strength and two time delays provides a number of regions in the parameter space where the time-delayed feedback control can successfully stabilize an otherwise unstable steady state. },

A 170, 421 (1992)] as a difference between the current system state and its state tau time units before. This approach combines the elements of renewal theory to estimate the essential features of the resulting stochastic process as functions of the parameters of the controlling term.},

  abstract = {Recently, the phase-flip bifurcation has been described as a fundamental transition in time-delay coupled, phase-synchronized nonlinear dynamical systems. The bifurcation is characterized by a change of the synchronized dynamics from being in-phase to antiphase, or vice versa; the phase-difference between the oscillators undergoes a jump of pi as a function of the coupling strength or the time delay. This phase-flip is accompanied by discontinuous changes in the frequency of the synchronized oscillators, and in the largest negative Lyapunov exponent or its derivative. Here we illustrate the phenomenology of the bifurcation for several classes of nonlinear oscillators, in the regimes of both periodic and chaotic dynamics. We present extensive numerical simulations and compute the oscillation frequencies and the Lyapunov spectra as a function of the coupling strength. In particular, our simulations provide clear evidence of the phase-flip bifurcation in excitable laser and Fitzhugh&#8211;Nagumo neuronal models, and in diffusively coupled predator-prey models with either limit cycle or chaotic dynamics. Our analysis demonstrates marked jumps of the time-delayed and instantaneous fluxes between the two interacting oscillators across the bifurcation; this has strong implications for the performance of the system as well as for practical applications. We further construct an electronic circuit consisting of two coupled Chua oscillators and provide the first formal experimental demonstration of the bifurcation. In totality, our study demonstrates that the phase-flip phenomenon is of broad relevance and importance for a wide range of physical and natural systems. },

  abstract = {The multifractal spectra of 3d Diffusion Tensor Images (DTI) obtained by magnetic resonance imaging of the human brain are studied. They are shown to deviate substantially from artificial brain images with the same white matter intensity. All spectra, obtained from 12 healthy subjects, show common characteristics indicating non-trivial moments of the intensity. To model the spectra the dynamics of the chaotic Ikeda map are used. The DTI multifractal spectra for positive q are best approximated by 3d coupled Ikeda maps in the fully developed chaotic regime. The coupling constants are as small as &#945;�=�0.01. These results reflect not only the white tissue non-trivial architectural complexity in the human brain, but also demonstrate the presence and importance of coupling between neuron axons. The architectural complexity is also mirrored by the deviations in the negative q-spectra, where the rare events dominate. To obtain a good agreement in the DTI negative q-spectrum of the brain with the Ikeda dynamics, it is enough to slightly modify the most rare events of the coupled Ikeda distributions. The representation of Diffusion Tensor Images with coupled Ikeda maps is not unique: similar conclusions are drawn when other chaotic maps (Tent, Logistic or Henon maps) are employed in the modelling of the neuron axons network.},

control. Without control, the oscillator can be synchronized by the periodic force only in a certain domain of
 
parameters. However, outside of this domain the system possesses unstable periodic orbits that can be stabi-
 
lized by delayed feedback perturbation. The feedback perturbation vanishes if the stabilization is successful
 
and thus the domain of synchronization can be extended with only small control force. We take advantage of
 
the fact that the system is close to a Hopf bifurcation and derive a simpli{\"i}�&#65533;ed averaged equation which we are
 
able to treat analytically even in the presence of the delayed feedback. As a result we obtain simple analytical
 
expressions de{\"i}�&#65533;ning the domain of synchronization of the controlled system as well as an optimal value of the
 
control gain. The analytical theory is supported by numerical simulations of the original delay-differential
 
equations.},

The results reveal that the generation and the stability of the completely synchronous state in such networks only depends on the input weight of each neuron, which is independent of the network structure. If the input weight is heterogenous in the networks, then a subgroup of bursting neurons, each having the same input weight, can be in almost completely synchronous states, and different subgroups with different input weights can be in burst synchronous states. The stability of this input weight determined synchronization is numerically studied by Lyapunov exponents, and the results show that the complete or burst synchronization in any complex neuronal networks is fully determined by the input weight of each neuron.},

  abstract = {This paper deals with the relatively new field of designing a Chaotic Pattern Recognition (PR) system. The benchmark of such a system is the following: First of all, one must be able to train the system with a set of {\^a}��training{\^a}�� patterns. Subsequently, as long as there is no testing pattern, the system must be chaotic. However, if the system is, thereafter, presented with an unknown testing pattern, the behavior must ideally be as follows. If the testing pattern is not one of the trained patterns, the system must continue to be chaotic. As opposed to this, if the testing pattern is truly one of the trained patterns (or a noisy version of a trained pattern), the system must switch to being periodic, with the specific trained pattern appearing periodically at the output. This is truly an ambitious goal, with the requirement of switching from chaos to periodicity being the most demanding. Some related work has been done in this regard. The Adachi Neural Network (AdNN) [1-5] has properties which are pseudo-chaotic, but it also possesses limited PR characteristics. As opposed to this, the Modified Adachi Neural Network (M-AdNN) proposed by Calitoiu et al [6], is a fascinating NN which has been shown to possess the required periodicity property desirable for PR applications. However, in this paper, we shall demonstrate that the PR properties claimed in [6] are not as powerful as originally reported. Indeed, the claim of the authors of [6] is true, in that it resonates periodically for trained input patterns. But unfortunately, the M-AdNN also resonates for unknown patterns and produces these unknown patterns at the output periodically. However, we describe how the parameters of the M-AdNN for its weights, steepness and external inputs, can be specified so as to yield a new NN, which we shall refer to as the Ideal-M-AdNN. Using a rigorous Lyapunov analysis, we shall analyze the chaotic properties of the Ideal-M-AdNN, and demonstrate its chaotic characteristics. Thereafter, we shall verify that the system is also truly chaotic for untrained patterns. But most importantly, we demonstrate that it is able to switch to being periodic whenever it encounters patterns with which it was trained. Apart from being quite fascinating, as far as we know, the theoretical and experimental results presented here are both unreported and novel. Indeed, we are not aware of any NN that possesses these properties!},

  abstract = {One of the most pressing and interesting actual scientific challenges deals with the analysis and the understanding of complex network dynamics. In particular, a major trend is the definition of new frameworks for the analysis, the exploration and the detection of the dynamics at play in real dynamic networks. In this paper, we focus in particular on scientific communities by targeting the social part of science through a descriptive approach that aims at identifying the social determinants behind the emergence and the resilience of scientific communities. We consider that scientific communities are at the same time through co-authorship communities of practice and that they exist also as representations in the scientists mind, since references to other scientists&#8217; works are not merely an objective link to a relevant work, but they reveal also social objects that one manipulates and refers to. In fact, our analysis focuses on the coexistence of co-authorships and citation dynamics and how their interplay affects the shape, the strength and the stability of the scientific systems. Such an analysis&#8212;performed through the time-varying graphs (TVG) formalism and derived metrics&#8212;concerns the evolution of a scientific network extracted from a portion of the arXiv repository covering a period of 10 years of publications in physics. We detect an example of how the selection process of citations may affect the shape of the co-authorships network from a sparser and disconnected structure to a dense and homogeneous one.},

  abstract = {The traveling wave model consisting of a hyperbolic system of linear first order PDE's nonlinearly coupled with a system of ODE's is used to model the dynamics of multisection semiconductor lasers. It is shown how low dimensional systems of ODE's based on the projection of the original system into the subspace spanned only by a few instantaneously changing spectral elements allow a precise approximation of the original model. The constructed low dimensional Mode Approximation systems are accessible to classical bifurcation analysis and numerical tools. The presented method is applied to characterise quasi-periodic orbits arising in a three section distributed feedback laser. The obtained results are highly important for tailoring such pulsating lasers to be applied in optical communication systems.},

The model is based on Maxwell-Bloch equations and takes into account the scattering of charge carriers between 2-D wetting layer states and bound quantum dot states, the amplification, and the wave-guiding of the light fields in the optical cavity. Simulations allow the analysis of the occupation probability of the quantum dot levels at steady state and during optical excitation by a femtosecond pulse. The influence of homogeneously and inhomogeneously broadened quantum dot media on spatial and spectral hole burning is revealed and discussed. It is shown that spatially varying dot properties lead to the reshaping of the optical pulse in the active medium.}},

Here, we present a measure of dependence for two-variable relationships: the maximal information coefficient (MIC). MIC captures a wide range of associations both functional and not, and for functional relationships provides a score that roughly equals the coefficient of determination (R2) of the data relative to the regression function. MIC belongs to a larger class of maximal information-based nonparametric exploration (MINE) statistics for identifying and classifying relationships. We apply MIC and MINE to data sets in global health, gene expression, major-league baseball, and the human gut microbiota and identify known and novel relationships.},

We aim to study safety and efficacy of tPA treatment in the 3- to 6-hour window using multimodal transcranial Doppler (TCD)/MRI selection criteria. Methods-- We studied patients with acute middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion. Patients within 0 to 3 hours from symptom onset (A) were treated according to standard computed tomography criteria. Treatment within 3 to 6 hours (B) was decided according to TCD/MRI protocol. Continuous TCD assessed clot location and recanalization. National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) at 24 hours assessed neurological improvement/worsening and modified Rankin score <3 functional independence at third month. Results-- Of 135 patients, 56 were in the 3- to 6-hour window. Only 13 (23%) patients within 3 to 6 hours did not meet MRI inclusion criteria. Finally, 122 patients were treated with tPA: A, 79 (65%); B, 43 (35%). Median time to treatment was: A, 136 minutes (range 60 to 180); B, 223 (185 to 360). There were no differences in demographic parameters, baseline NIHSS (A, 17; B, 17; P=0.89), and occlusion location (proximal MCA A, 65.8%; B, 74.4%; P=0.28). Recanalization rates at 2 hours were similar (A, 49.3%; B, 55.2%; P=0.33), as were hemorrhagic transformation rates (asymptomatic: A, 18.7%, B, 26.6%}, 
p={0.66). Improvement at discharge was similar in both groups (NIHSS dropped 6.3 points [A] versus 6.1 [B]; P=0.86). However, 
 the number of patients who benefited from treatment was slightly higher in the 3- to 6-hour group (A, 
 58.2%; B, 
 76.2%; P=0.05), 
 whereas the same rate of patients worsened (A, 
 11.4%; B, 
 7.1%; P=0.46). At 3 months, 
 the rate of independent patients was: A, 
 42% versus B, 
 38% (P=0.74). Conclusions-- tPA treatment can be safely and effectively extended to the 3- to 6-hour window using TCD/MRI selection criteria. Not using these criteria in the 3- to 6-hour window avoids potentially effective treatment in a high rate of patients. }},

  abstract = {The paper investigates the possibilities of using clustering techniques in visual exploration and analysis of large numbers of trajectories, that is, sequences of time-stamped locations of some moving entities. Trajectories are complex spatio-temporal constructs characterized by diverse non-trivial properties. To assess the degree of (dis)similarity between trajectories, specific methods (distance functions) are required. A single distance function accounting for all properties of trajectories, (1) is difficult to build, (2) would require much time to compute, and (3) might be difficult to understand and to use. We suggest the procedure of progressive clustering where a simple distance function with a clear meaning is applied on each step, which leads to easily interpretable outcomes. Successive application of several different functions enables sophisticated analyses through gradual refinement of earlier obtained results. Besides the advantages from the sense-making perspective, progressive clustering enables a rational work organization where time-consuming computations are applied to relatively small potentially interesting subsets obtained by means of &#8216;cheap&#8217; distance functions producing quick results. We introduce the concept of progressive clustering by an example of analyzing a large real data set. We also review the existing clustering methods, describe the method OPTICS suitable for progressive clustering of trajectories, and briefly present several distance functions for trajectories.},

  abstract = {We consider a pair of differential equations whose solutions exhibit the qualitative properties of nerve conduction, yet which are simple enough to be solved exactly and explicitly. The equations are of the FitzHugh-Nagumo type, with a piecewise linear nonlinearity, and they contain two parameters. All the pulse and periodic solutions, and their propagation speeds, are found for these equations, and the stability of the solutions is analyzed. For certain parameter values, there are two different pulse-shaped waves with different propagation speeds. The slower pulse is shown to be unstable and the faster one to be stable, confirming conjectures which have been made before for other nerve conduction equations. Two periodic waves, representing trains of propagated impulses, are also found for each period greater than some minimum which depends on the parameters. The slower train is unstable and the faster one is usually stable, although in some cases both are unstable.},

We illustrate the applicability of the algorithm for the paradigmatic chaotic Rossler system in the funnel regime and for noisy data, where other methods to detect phase synchronization fail. Furthermore, we demonstrate for electrochemical experiments that the method can easily detect phase and generalized synchronization in non-phase-coherent and even non-stationary time series.},

The stepwise historical evolution of these different zones is described. The current diagnostic techniques used in the definition of these cortical zones, such as video-EEG monitoring, MRI and ictal single photon emission computed tomography, are discussed. Established diagnostic tests are set apart from procedures that should still be regarded as experimental, such as magnetoencephalography, dipole source localization and spike-triggered functional MRI. Possible future developments that might lead to a more direct definition of the epileptogenic zone are presented.},

  abstract = {We present the new effect of phase synchronization of weakly coupled self-sustained chaotic oscillators. To characterize this phenomenon, we use the analytic signal approach based on the Hilbert transform and partial Poincar{\'e} maps. For coupled R{\"o}ssler attractors, in the synchronous regime the phases are locked, while the amplitudes vary chaotically and are practically uncorrelated. Coupling a chaotic oscillator with a hyperchaotic one, we observe another new type of synchronization, where the frequencies are entrained, while the phase difference is unbounded. A relation between the phase synchronization and the properties of the Lyapunov spectrum is studied.},

The dynamical behaviour and the state space representation in stochastic field of the optical QED system provide the basis for developing quantum feedback QED control system. This study is also motivated by the design of quantum networks of any number of optical QED baths connected in parallel. Nyquist stability of the feedback control system in the interacting Fock space using two-mode beam splitter device at the input and a single-mode fractional beam splitter device at the output of the cavity has been analysed. The degree of stability of the quantum feedback control system of the cavity QED is studied by measuring gain margin and phase margin of the system in terms of parameters of the beam splitter.},

Using the {Fokker-Planck} formalism, we show that the equilibrium synaptic distribution induced by such rules is highly sensitive to the manner in which bounds on the allowed range of synaptic values are imposed. In a biologically plausible multiplicative model, the synapses in asynchronous networks reach a distribution that is invariant to the firing rates of either the presynaptic or postsynaptic cells. When these cells are temporally correlated, the synaptic strength varies smoothly with the degree and phase of their synchrony.},

By simultaneously recording multiple local field potential signals across the primary motor and dorsal premotor cortices of monkeys (Macaca mulatta) trained to perform an instructed-delay reaching task, we found that these oscillations propagated as waves across the surface of the motor cortex along dominant spatial axes characteristic of the local circuitry of the motor cortex. Moreover, we found that information about the visual target to be reached was encoded in terms of both latency and amplitude of evoked waves at a time when the field phase-locked with respect to the target onset. These findings suggest that high-frequency oscillations may subserve intra- and inter-cortical information transfer during movement preparation and execution.},

  abstract = {Synchronization of chaotic systems is frequently taken to mean actual equality of the variables of the coupled systems as they evolve in time. We explore a generalization of this condition, which equates dynamical variables from one subsystem with a function of the variables of another subsystem. This means that synchronization implies a collapse of the overall evolution onto a subspace of the system attractor in full space. We explore this idea in systems where a response system y(t) is driven with the output of a driving system x(t), but there is no feedback to the driver. We lose generality but gain tractability with this restriction. To investigate the existence of the synchronization condition y(t)=&#966;(x(t)) we introduce the idea of mutual false nearest neighbors to determine when closeness in response space implies closeness in driving space. The synchronization condition also implies that the response dynamics is determined by the drive alone, and we provide tests for this as well. Examples are drawn from computer simulations on various known cases of synchronization and on data from nonlinear electrical circuits. Determining the presence of generalized synchronization will be quite important when one has only scalar observations from the drive and from the response systems since the use of time delay (or other) embedding methods will produce &#8216;&#8216;imperfect&#8217;&#8217; coordinates in which strict equality of the synchronized variables is unlikely to transpire.},

  abstract = {The study presented here is the first detailed nosographic analysis of migraine aura, diagnosed using the criteria of the International Headache Society, in a sufficiently large sample for statistical analysis. Of 4000 people, 163 had migraine with aura. Sixty-two had attacks of migraine aura with headache as well as migraine aura without headache, and seven had exclusively migraine aura without headache. Visual symptoms were most frequent (99%), followed by sensory (31%), aphasic (18%) and motor (6%) symptoms. Those with several types of aura symptoms had visual aura in virtually every attack, while sensory, motor and aphasic aura were present only in a small number of their attacks. The typical visual aura starts as a flickering, uncoloured, zig-zag line in the centre of the visual field and affect the central vision. It gradually progresses towards the periphery of one hemifield and often leaves a scotoma. The typical sensory aura is unilateral, starts in the hand, progresses towards the arm and then affects the face and tongue. The typical motor aura is half-sided and affects the hand and arm. The visual, sensory and aphasic auras rarely lasted >1 h, while the motor aura did in 67% (six out of nine). Four people had exclusively acute onset visual aura. The duration of the aura and the characteristics of the ensuing headache were typical for migraine with aura, suggesting that acute onset aura is a real phenomenon. Headache followed the aura in 93%, headache and aura occurred simultaneously in 4% and aura followed headache in 3%. The characteristic spread of each symptom and the sequence of different symptoms suggest that cortical spreading depression is the mechanism underlying the migraine aura. Our results do not suggest that alterations of the diagnostic criteria of the International Headache Society are needed. The intraindividual variation of aura symptoms shown in this study indicates that a simplification of the International Classification of Diseases, Neurological Adaptation is appropriate.},

We develop the control profile, a statistic that quantifies the different proportions of control-inducing structures present in a network. We find that standard random network models do not reproduce the kinds of control profiles that are observed in real-world networks. The profiles of real networks form three well-defined clusters that provide insight into the high-level organization and function of complex systems.},

In critical human systems facing risk, such as financial markets or military operations, our understanding of the benefits associated with synchronicity is nascent but promising. Building on previous work illuminating commonalities between ecological and human systems, we compare the activity patterns of individual financial traders with the simultaneous activity of other traders&#8212;an individual and spontaneous characteristic we call synchronous trading. Additionally, we examine the association of synchronous trading with individual performance and communication patterns. Analyzing empirical data on day traders&#8217; second-to-second trading and instant messaging, we find that the higher the traders&#8217; synchronous trading is, the less likely they are to lose money at the end of the day. We also find that the daily instant messaging patterns of traders are closely associated with their level of synchronous trading. This result suggests that synchronicity and vanguard technology may help traders cope with risky decisions in complex systems and may furnish unique prospects for achieving collective and individual goals.},

Our study introduces a general method that focuses on bundles of words that behave differently from daily communication routines, and uses original data covering the content of instant messages among all day traders at a trading firm over a 40-month period. Analyses show that two word bundles convey traders' understanding of same day market events and potential next day market events. We find that when market volatility is high, traders' communications are dominated by same day events, and when volatility is low, communications are dominated by next day events. We show that the stronger the traders' attention to either same day or next day events, the higher their collective trading performance. We conclude that e-communication among traders is a product of mass collaboration over diverse viewpoints that embodies unique information about their weak or strong understanding of the market.},

Based on a coupled set of rate equations considering both the size distribution of quantum dots and a series of longitudinal cavity modes, we show that dots with different energies start lasing independently due to their spatial localization when the gain spectrum is a delta-like function, and that the dot ensemble contributes to a narrow-line lasing collectively under large homogeneous broadening. The result explains quite excellently the experimental lasing spectra found in self-assembled InGaAs-GaAs quantum-dot lasers},

  abstract = {The most frequent infectious diseases in humans&#8212;and those with the highest potential for rapid pandemic spread&#8212;are usually transmitted via droplets during close proximity interactions (CPIs). Despite the importance of this transmission route, very little is known about the dynamic patterns of CPIs. Using wireless sensor network technology, we obtained high-resolution data of CPIs during a typical day at an American high school, permitting the reconstruction of the social network relevant for infectious disease transmission. At 94% coverage, we collected 762,868 CPIs at a maximal distance of 3 m among 788 individuals. The data revealed a high-density network with typical small-world properties and a relatively homogeneous distribution of both interaction time and interaction partners among subjects. Computer simulations of the spread of an influenza-like disease on the weighted contact graph are in good agreement with absentee data during the most recent influenza season. Analysis of targeted immunization strategies suggested that contact network data are required to design strategies that are significantly more effective than random immunization. Immunization strategies based on contact network data were most effective at high vaccination coverage.},

  abstract = {A brain, a neural structure located in the head, differs from a ganglion by the following characteristics: (1) a brain subserves the entire body, not just restricted segments; (2) it has functionally specialized parts; (3) it is bilobar; (4) commissures and neurons form the surface with axons in the central core; (5) interneurons are more numerous than primary motor or primary sensory neurons; and (6) multisynaptic rather than monosynaptic circuits predominate. A &#8220;cephalic ganglion&#8221; does not exist in any living animal and probably never occurred even in extinct ancestral species. It also is not a developmental stage in the ontogenesis of any vertebrate. Amphioxus may represent an intermediate stage in the evolution of the vertebrate nervous system, but the anatomic relationship between the notochord and neural tube is more complex. The decussating interneuron of amphioxus, to mediate a primitive coiling reflex away from any stimulus, provides a phylogenetic explanation for the pattern of crossed long ascending and descending pathways in the subsequent evolution of the vertebrate central nervous system. The evolution of the vertebrate central nervous system may have begun with free-living flatworms (planaria) that evolved before the divergence of metazoans into invertebrate and chordate branches. The planarian is the simplest animal to develop a body plan of bilateral symmetry and axes of growth with gradients of genetic expression, enabling cephalization, dorsal and ventral surfaces, medial and lateral regions, and an aggregate of neural cells in the head that form a bilobed brain. Neurons of the planarian brain more closely resemble those of vertebrates than those of advanced invertebrates, exhibiting typical vertebrate features of multipolar shape, dendritic spines with synaptic boutons, a single axon, expression of vertebrate-like neural proteins, and relatively slow spontaneously generated electrical activity. The planarian is thus not only the first animal to possess a brain, but may be the ancestor of the vertebrate brain.},

We here adapt the nonlinear method of unscented Kalman filtering to observe the state and estimate parameters in a computational spatiotemporal excitable system that serves as a model for cerebral cortex. We demonstrate the ability to track spiral wave dynamics, and to use an observer system to calculate control signals delivered through applied electrical fields. We demonstrate how this strategy can control the frequency of such a system, or quench the wave patterns, while minimizing the energy required for such results. These findings are readily testable in experimental applications, and have the potential to be applied to the treatment of human disease.},

  abstract = {We show that a spiral wave core can be guided by feedback control through a two-dimensional (2D) medium along a virtual 1D detector of given shape. To this aim, short perturbations of excitability are applied globally to the medium each time the spiral wave front is tangent to the detector, or touches its open ends. This relatively simple and robust feedback algorithm is realized in experiments with the light-sensitive Belousov-Zhabotinsky (BZ) medium and in numerical simulations of the underlying Oregonator model. A theory is developed that reduces the description of the spiral wave drift to an iterated map from which the drift velocity field for the motion of the spiral core can be obtained. This drift velocity field predicts both the transient as well as the stationary trajectories of the drifting spiral waves in good agreement with experimental and numerical data. It is shown that the drift velocity is limited by instabilities which arise under high perturbation strength or large delay time. We propose a method to suppress the observed instabilities in order to increase the velocity of feedback mediated resonant drift. Our results might be useful for the control of spiral wave location in a wide variety of excitable media.},

  abstract = {Boolean models of regulatory networks are assumed to be tolerant to perturbations. That qualitatively implies that each function can only depend on a few nodes. Biologically motivated constraints further show that functions found in Boolean regulatory networks belong to certain classes of functions, for example, the unate functions. It turns out that these classes have specific properties in the Fourier domain. That motivates us to study the problem of detecting controlling nodes in classes of Boolean networks using spectral techniques. We consider networks with unbalanced functions and functions of an average sensitivity less than 23 k, where k is the number of controlling variables for a function. Further, we consider the class of 1-low networks which include unate networks, linear threshold networks, and networks with nested canalyzing functions. We show that the application of spectral learning algorithms leads to both better time and sample complexity for the detection of controlling nodes compared with algorithms based on exhaustive search. For a particular algorithm, we state analytical upper bounds on the number of samples needed to find the controlling nodes of the Boolean functions. Further, improved algorithms for detecting controlling nodes in large-scale unate networks are given and numerically studied.},

  abstract = {Human mobility is differentiated by time scales. While the mechanism for long time scales has been studied, the underlying mechanism on the daily scale is still unrevealed. Here, we uncover the mechanism responsible for the daily mobility patterns by analysing the temporal and spatial trajectories of thousands of persons as individual networks. Using the concept of motifs from network theory, we find only 17 unique networks are present in daily mobility and they follow simple rules. These networks, called here motifs, are sufficient to capture up to 90 per cent of the population in surveys and mobile phone datasets for different countries. Each individual exhibits a characteristic motif, which seems to be stable over several months. Consequently, daily human mobility can be reproduced by an analytically tractable framework for Markov chains by modelling periods of high-frequency trips followed by periods of lower activity as the key ingredient.},

  abstract = {Coherent multidimensional spectroscopy allows us to inspect the energies and the coupling of quantum systems. Coupled quantum systems&#8212;such as a coupled semiconductor quantum dot or pigments in photosynthesis&#8212;form delocalized exciton and two-exciton states. A technique is presented to decompose these delocalized wave functions into the basis of individual quantum emitters. This quantum state tomography protocol is illustrated for three coupled InAs quantum dots. To achieve the decomposition of the wavefunction, we combine the double-quantum-coherence spectroscopy with spatiotemporal control, which allows us to localize optical excitations at a specific quantum dot. Recently, a protocol was proposed for single exciton states(Richter�et al 2012 Phys. Rev. B 86 085308). In this paper, we extend the method presented by Richter et al with respect to: the reconstruction of two-exciton states, a detailed analysis process of reconstruction and the effect of filtering to enhance the quality of the reconstructed wave function.},

These observations suggest that different-size networks self-organize to adjust their activities over many time scales.

In this paper we report identification of phase synchronization in coupled time-delay systems exhibiting hyperchaotic attractor. We show that there is a transition from nonsynchronized behavior to phase and then to generalized synchronization as a function of coupling strength. These transitions are characterized by recurrence quantification analysis, by phase differences based on a transformation of the attractors, and also by the changes in the Lyapunov exponents. We have found these transitions in coupled piecewise linear and in Mackey-Glass time-delay systems.},

In this paper we discuss some of its features, including discontinuity tracking, iteration for short delays, and event location. We also develop some theoretical results that underlie the solver, including convergence, error estimation, and the effects of short delays on stability. Some examples illustrate the use of dde23 and show it to be a capable DDE solver that is exceptionally easy to use.},

  abstract = {Inferring the network topology from dynamical observations is a fundamental problem pervading research on complex systems. Here, we present a simple, direct method for inferring the structural connection topology of a network, given an observation of one collective dynamical trajectory. The general theoretical framework is applicable to arbitrary network dynamical systems described by ordinary differential equations. No interference (external driving) is required and the type of dynamics is hardly restricted in any way. In particular, the observed dynamics may be arbitrarily complex; stationary, invariant or transient; synchronous or asynchronous and chaotic or periodic. Presupposing a knowledge of the functional form of the dynamical units and of the coupling functions between them, we present an analytical solution to the inverse problem of finding the network topology from observing a time series of state variables only. Robust reconstruction is achieved in any sufficiently long generic observation of the system. We extend our method to simultaneously reconstructing both the entire network topology and all parameters appearing linear in the system's equations of motion. Reconstruction of network topology and system parameters is viable even in the presence of external noise that distorts the original dynamics substantially. The method provides a conceptually new step towards reconstructing a variety of real-world networks, including gene and protein interaction networks and neuronal circuits.},

  abstract = {Spontaneous neuronal activity is a ubiquitous feature of cortex. Its spatiotemporal organization reflects past input and modulates future network output. Here we study whether a particular type of spontaneous activity is generated by a network that is optimized for input processing. Neuronal avalanches are a type of spontaneous activity observed in superficial cortical layers in vitro and in vivo with statistical properties expected from a network operating at &#8220;criticality.&#8221; Theory predicts that criticality and, therefore, neuronal avalanches are optimal for input processing, but until now, this has not been tested in experiments. Here, we use cortex slice cultures grown on planar microelectrode arrays to demonstrate that cortical networks that generate neuronal avalanches benefit from a maximized dynamic range, i.e., the ability to respond to the greatest range of stimuli. By changing the ratio of excitation and inhibition in the cultures, we derive a network tuning curve for stimulus processing as a function of distance from criticality in agreement with predictions from our simulations. Our findings suggest that in the cortex, (1) balanced excitation and inhibition establishes criticality, which maximizes the range of inputs that can be processed, and (2) spontaneous activity and input processing are unified in the context of critical phenomena.},

- a medium-ranged activator and a localized inhibitor - that describe the solid phase. Patterns are classified according to
 
their symmetry properties. Patterns may emerge already with simple bistable kinetics in a plug-flow reactor (i.e., a single
 
integrodifferential equation). Pattern selection is determined by the phase planes spanned by the reactor, by the ratio of front
 
residence time to the period of oscillations and by the ratio of convection to fluid-phase diffusions terms. Patterns include
 
stationary or oscillatory fronts or pulses, antiphase oscillations which appear at the transition from homogeneous solution,
 
unidirectional pulses that are the dominant pattems when mixing is weak and stationary or oscillatory waves that emerge with
 
strong fluid-mixing. The simple tbrm of the model allows us to suggest a general classification of emerging patterns and to
 
identify the corresponding conditions in term of realistic models of reactors.},

  abstract = {Hybrid testing, which couples physical experiments and computer simulations bidirectionally and in real-time, is a promising experimental technique in engineering. One fundamental problem of this technique are delays in the coupling between simulation and experiment. We discuss this issue for a simple prototype hybrid system: a pendulum that is vertically excited by coupling it to a simulated linear mass-spring-damper system. Under realistic conditions a small delay in the coupling can give rise to an essential instability: the linearisation has infinitely many unstable eigenvalues for arbitrarily small delay. This type of instability is impossible to compensate for with any of the standard compensation techniques. We introduce an approach based on feedback control and Newton iterations that is able to overcome this instability. The basic idea behind our approach consists of two parts. First, we change the bidirectional coupling between experiment and computer simulation to a unidirectional coupling and stabilise the experiment with a feedback loop. Second, we place the modified hybrid system into a Newton iteration scheme. If the iteration converges then the hybrid experiment behaves just as the original emulated system (within the experimental accuracy). We demonstrate, by using a computer simulation for the experimental part, that our approach is able to overcome the essential instability. In combination with path-following methods, it allows us to track oscillations and their bifurcations systematically.},

  abstract = {Studies of disease spreading on complex networks have provided a deep insight into the conditions of onset, dynamics and prevention of epidemics in human populations and malicious software propagation in computer networks. Identifying nodes which, when initially infected, infect the largest part of the network and ranking them according to their epidemic impact is a priority for public health policies. In simulations of the disease spreading in SIR model on studied empirical complex networks, it is shown that the ranking depends on the dynamical regime of the disease spreading. A possible mechanism leading to this dynamical dependence is illustrated in an analytically tractable example. A measure called epidemic centrality, averaging the epidemic impact over all possible disease spreading regimes, is introduced as a basis of epidemic ranking. Contrary to standard notion, the epidemic centrality of nodes with high degree, k-cores value or betweenness, which are structurally central, is comparable to epidemic centrality of structurally peripheral nodes. These findings indicate that the impact of an epidemic starting at structurally peripheral nodes may be considerably underestimated. Network periphery should gain a more prominent role in the allocation of resources in future epidemic preparedness plans.},

  abstract = {Injection locking of a semiconductor laser can induce major changes in the modulation characteristics of the laser. A small-signal analysis using the lumped element model shows that both the frequency and damping of the characteristic resonances of the coupled complex field and free carriers (gain medium) are modified. The detuning between the injected field and the free-running oscillating field, the amplitude of the injection field relative to the free-running field, the linewidth enhancement factor, the cavity photon and spontaneous carrier decay rates, and the field enhancement of the decay rate are all key parameters in determining the changes to the modulation characteristics. For a broad range of parameters, there is simultaneous enhancement of the modulation bandwidth and stable, locked operation. The enhancement is a cavity phenomena and does not occur in a traveling wave amplifier. It requires that the frequency of the locking field be detuned from the injection-modified frequency of the cavity resonance. This causes a resonant enhancement of the modulation sideband associated with the preferred frequency of the optical cavity. Bandwidth enhancements beyond the free-running laser limit are possible over a range of injection levels and injection frequency detunings},

We also numerically establish the existence of chimera ordering in 3-dimensional models of layered magnetic materials (such as manganites) suggesting possible means of experimentally observing it.},

  abstract = {All-optical clock recovery from 40-Gb/s nonreturn-to-zero (NRZ) pseudorandom binary sequence data streams based on self-pulsating lasers is presented. A compact preprocessing circuit is utilized to convert an NRZ signal to a pseudoreturn-to-zero sequence before injecting into the optical clock. It comprises a semiconductor optical amplifier followed by a periodical wavelength-division-multiplexing demultiplexer filter. A stable sinusoidal clock signal with a root-mean-square jitter below 700 fs is detected at the output of the self-pulsating laser within data dynamic range of more than 8 dB. The performance of the all-optical clock recovery scheme is investigated by varying the bit rates between 39.81 and 43.02 Gb/s as well as for various wavelengths in the C-band.},

Here we explore the limits of predictability in human dynamics by studying the mobility patterns of anonymized mobile phone users. By measuring the entropy of each individual's trajectory, we find a 93% potential predictability in user mobility across the whole user base. Despite the significant differences in the travel patterns, we find a remarkable lack of variability in predictability, which is largely independent of the distance users cover on a regular basis.},

  abstract = {Neuroanatomy places critical constraints on the functional connectivity of the cerebral cortex. To analyze these constraints we have examined the relationship between structural features of networks (expressed as graphs) and the patterns of functional connectivity to which they give rise when implemented as dynamical systems. We selected among structurally varying graphs using as selective criteria a number of global information-theoretical measures that characterize functional connectivity. We selected graphs separately for increases in measures of entropy (capturing statistical independence of graph elements), integration (capturing their statistical dependence) and complexity (capturing the interplay between their functional segregation and integration). We found that dynamics with high complexity were supported by graphs whose units were organized into densely linked groups that were sparsely and reciprocally interconnected. Connection matrices based on actual neuroanatomical data describing areas and pathways of the macaque visual cortex and the cat cortex showed structural characteristics that coincided best with those of such complex graphs, revealing the presence of distinct but interconnected anatomical groupings of areas. Moreover, when implemented as dynamical systems, these cortical connection matrices generated functional connectivity with high complexity, characterized by the presence of highly coherent functional clusters. We also found that selection of graphs as they responded to input or produced output led to increases in the complexity of their dynamics. We hypothesize that adaptation to rich sensory environments and motor demands requires complex dynamics and that these dynamics are supported by neuroanatomical motifs that are characteristic of the cerebral cortex.},

  abstract = {Time invariant description of synaptic connectivity in cortical circuits may be precluded by the ongoing growth and retraction of dendritic spines accompanied by the formation and elimination of synapses. On the other hand, the spatial arrangement of axonal and dendritic branches appears stable. This suggests that an invariant description of connectivity can be cast in terms of potential synapses, which are locations in the neuropil where an axon branch of one neuron is proximal to a dendritic branch of another neuron. In this paper, we attempt to reconstruct the potential connectivity in local cortical circuits of the cat primary visual cortex (V1). Based on multiple single-neuron reconstructions of axonal and dendritic arbors in 3 dimensions, we evaluate the expected number of potential synapses and the probability of potential connectivity among excitatory (pyramidal and spiny stellate) neurons and inhibitory basket cells. The results provide a quantitative description of structural organization of local cortical circuits. For excitatory neurons from different cortical layers, we compute local domains, which contain their potentially pre- and postsynaptic excitatory partners. These domains have columnar shapes with laminar specific radii and are roughly of the size of the ocular dominance column. Therefore, connections between most excitatory neurons in the ocular dominance column can be implemented by local synaptogenesis. Structural connectivity involving inhibitory basket cells is generally weaker than excitatory connectivity. Here, only nearby neurons are capable of establishing more than one potential synapse, implying that within the ocular dominance column these connections have more limited potential for circuit remodeling.},

  abstract = {Mechanical models of human self-balancing often use the Newtonian equations of inverted pendula. While these mathematical models are precise enough on the mechanical side, the ways humans balance them selves are still quite unexplored on the control side. Time delays in the sensory and motoric neural pathways give essential limitations to the stabilization of the human body as a multiple inverted pendulum. The sensory systems supporting each other provide the necessary signals for these control tasks; but the more complicated the system is, the larger delay is introduced. Human ageing as well as our actual physical an d mental state affects the time delays in the neural system, and the mechanical structure of the human body also changes in a large range during our lives. The human balancing organ, the labyrinth, and the vision system essentially adapted to these relatively large time delays and parameter regions occurring during balancing. The analytical study of the simplified large-scale time-delayed models of balancing provides a N ewtonian insight into the functioning of these organs that may also serve as a basis to support theories and hypotheses on balancing and vision.},

Here we study the relative effects of vaccinations and avoidance of infected individuals in a susceptible&#8211;infected&#8211;recovered (SIR) epidemic model on a dynamic small-world network. We derive the critical mobility required for an outbreak to occur as a function of the disease&#8217;s infectivity, recovery rate, avoidance rate, and vaccination rate. We also derive an expression that allows us to calculate the amount of vaccination and/or avoidance necessary to prevent an epidemic. Calculated quantities show excellent agreement with simulations.},

  abstract = {Dynamic small-world networks combine fixed short-range links within a node's local neighborhood with time-varying stochastic long-range links outside of that neighborhood. The probability of a long-range link occurring, p , is a measure of the mobility, or equivalently, the randomness of the population and is analogous to the standard static small-world rewiring parameter. In this study, we investigate the non-epidemic to epidemic phase transition that occurs in a susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) propagation model within this type of dynamic network. We first derive the finite-valued critical randomness p c and find excellent agreement with numerical simulations. Close to p c , the order parameter, which is given by the fraction of the population infected during the outbreak, scales as ( p &#8722; p c ) &#946; since it is a continuous transition; we find that &#946; is near 2, but varies as a function of p c . At the critical point, our study shows that the distribution of outbreak sizes follows a power law characterized by an exponent of &#8776;�1.5 in agreement with the value found in related small-world models, leading us to conjecture that it may be a universal feature of these models.},

In particular, we study the scenario recently found by Go�mez-Garden&#732;es et al. [Phys. Rev. E 73, 056124 (2006)] in which macroscopic global synchronization emerges through a process whereby many small synchronized clusters form, grow, and merge, eventually leading to a macroscopic giant synchronized component. Our main result is that this scenario is robust to an increase in the number of oscillators or a change in the distribution function of the oscillators&#8217; natural frequencies, but becomes less prominent as the number of links per oscillator increases.},

The system exhibits two modes of motion: translation and a coherent rotation in a torus-shape structure. We observe noise-induced transitions in both directions between the two states. These occur at different noise intensities, thus leading to a hysteresis curve. For certain parameter regions, the system switches persistently between the states such that the center of mass alternates between ballistic and diffusive motion. The coherent rotation leads to a pronounced mean angular momentum that changes its direction diffusively. We derive an analytic expression for the diffusion of the angular momentum of one particle in an external harmonic potential and show that it is always faster than the stochastic switching of the direction of motion in the two-dimensional case.},

The Si/SiGe RITDs exhibited a peak-to-valley current ratio (PVCR) up to 2.8 and peak current density (J(p)) of 0.26 kA/cm(2) at room temperature. This study focused on the utilization of a pair of tunnel diodes connected in series to form a latch. Employing a FET to supply current into the latch, a RITD/NMOS monostable-bistable transition logic element (MOBILE) was realized. The latch exhibited a voltage swing of 84\% at an applied supply voltage of 0.5 V. This logic element enables low voltage operation for high density circuit design of embedded memory.

We calculated their continuous-wave and 40-Gbit/s dynamic performance, and compared them with 1.55-�m SOAs with bulk InGaAsP active layers. The results demonstrate that quantum-dot SOAs can process multiple-wavelength high bit-rate optical pulse trains over 40 Gbit/s under gain saturation. This promises diverse functions like regeneration, reshaping, multiple-wavelength processing, wavelength conversion, and demultiplexing of high-bit-rate patterned optical signals, which meet with the demand of next-generation broadband all-optical photonic networks.},

Analogous to the MSF for identical systems, our generalized MSF simultaneously solves the linear-stability problem for near-synchronous states (NSS) for all possible connectivity structures. We also derive a general sufficient condition for stable near-synchronization and show that the synchronization error scales linearly with the magnitude of parameter variations. Our analysis underlines the significant role played by the Laplacian eigenvectors in the study of network synchronization of near-identical systems.},

These parts have been grouped in at least five different ways corresponding to five different theories about its basic plan or architecture. Two classical models that remain popular today are derived from (1) comparative anatomy and the body's segmental organization, and (2) comparative embryology and the neural tube's transverse and longitudinal organization. A new approach is concerned with deciphering the genetic program that assembles the nervous system during embryogenesis; how it will correspond to the other models remains to be determined. The simplest current model to explain the organization of the mammalian nervous system involves a segmental trunk that mediates reflex sensory&#8211;motor functions, and suprasegmental cerebral hemispheres and cerebellum.},

dx(t)/dt = f(t, x(t-&#964;0), x(t-&#964;1), ..., x(t-&#964;r), &#955;).
 

 
To start the continuation, the software needs an initial periodic solution x0(t) at some parameter value &#955;0. This starting periodic solution has to be specified either in the system definition (C   source file) or it can be loaded from an input file. The periodic solutions can bifurcate in several ways. If one of the three common codimension-one bifurcations (fold, period doubling, Neimark-Sacker) is found along the branch of periodic solutions, the point can be used as a starting point for continuing the branch of bifurcation points in a two parameter space.
 

 
Equilibria of autonomous systems can be also handled, as periodic solutions of periodic systems by keeping the period constant. Although it is very inefficient, this capability might be useful, when looking for periodic orbits arising at Hopf bifurcations points. Hopf bifurcations of fixed points are detected as Neimark-Sacker bifurcations, and the periodic solutions emanating from such points can be continued by switching to the periodic solution branch. },

  abstract = {Quantification of human group-behavior has so far defied an empirical, falsifiable approach. This is due to tremendous difficulties in data acquisition of social systems. Massive multiplayer online games (MMOG) provide a fascinating new way of observing hundreds of thousands of simultaneously socially interacting individuals engaged in virtual economic activities. We have compiled a data set consisting of practically all actions of all players over a period of 3 years from a MMOG played by 300,000 people. This large-scale data set of a socio-economic unit contains all social and economic data from a single and coherent source. Players have to generate a virtual income through economic activities to &#8216;survive&#8217; and are typically engaged in a multitude of social activities offered within the game. Our analysis of high-frequency log files focuses on three types of social networks, and tests a series of social-dynamics hypotheses. In particular we study the structure and dynamics of friend-, enemy- and communication networks. We find striking differences in topological structure between positive (friend) and negative (enemy) tie networks. All networks confirm the recently observed phenomenon of network densification. We propose two approximate social laws in communication networks, the first expressing betweenness centrality as the inverse square of the overlap, the second relating communication strength to the cube of the overlap. These empirical laws provide strong quantitative evidence for the Weak ties hypothesis of Granovetter. Further, the analysis of triad significance profiles validates well-established assertions from social balance theory. We find overrepresentation (underrepresentation) of complete (incomplete) triads in networks of positive ties, and vice versa for networks of negative ties. Empirical transition probabilities between triad classes provide evidence for triadic closure with extraordinarily high precision. For the first time we provide empirical results for large-scale networks of negative social ties. Whenever possible we compare our findings with data from non-virtual human groups and provide further evidence that online game communities serve as a valid model for a wide class of human societies. With this setup we demonstrate the feasibility for establishing a &#8216;socio-economic laboratory&#8217; which allows to operate at levels of precision approaching those of the natural sciences. All data used in this study is fully anonymized; the authors have the written consent to publish from the legal department of the Medical University of Vienna.},

The collective behavior is believed to arise through communication by chemical signaling via the extracellular solution. We studied large, heterogeneous populations of discrete chemical oscillators ([~]100,000) with well-defined kinetics to characterize two different types of density-dependent transitions to synchronized oscillatory behavior. For different chemical exchange rates between the oscillators and the surrounding solution, increasing oscillator density led to (i) the gradual synchronization of oscillatory activity, or (ii) the sudden "switching on" of synchronized oscillatory activity. We analyze the roles of oscillator density and exchange rate of signaling species in these transitions with a mathematical model of the interacting chemical oscillators.},

The transition is found to be always continuous, while the critical indexes vary with continuity with the power-law exponent characterizing the interaction. Strong numerical evidences indicate that the transition belongs to the anomalous directed percolation family of universality classes found for L{\'e}vy-flight spreading of epidemic processes.},

  abstract = {Common experience suggests that attracting invariant sets in nonlinear dynamical systems are generally stable. Contrary to this intuition, we present a dynamical system, a network of pulse-coupled oscillators, in which unstable attractors arise naturally. From random initial conditions, groups of synchronized oscillators (clusters) are formed that send pulses alternately, resulting in a periodic dynamics of the network. Under the influence of arbitrarily weak noise, this synchronization is followed by a desynchronization of clusters, a phenomenon induced by attractors that are unstable. Perpetual synchronization and desynchronization lead to a switching among attractors. This is explained by the geometrical fact, that these unstable attractors are surrounded by basins of attraction of other attractors, whereas the full measure of their own basin is located remote from the attractor. Unstable attractors do not only exist in these systems, but moreover dominate the dynamics for large networks and a wide range of parameters.},

For general neuron rise functions, stability is determined by multiple operators, for which standard analysis is not suitable. We describe a general nonstandard solution to the multioperator problem. Subsequently, we derive a class of neuronal rise functions for which all stability operators become degenerate and standard eigenvalue analysis becomes a suitable tool. Interestingly, this class is found to consist of networks of leaky integrate-and-fire neurons. For random networks of inhibitory integrate-and-fire neurons, we then develop an analytical approach, based on the theory of random matrices, to precisely determine the eigenvalue distributions of the stability operators. This yields the asymptotic relaxation time for perturbations to the synchronous state which provides the characteristic time scale on which neurons can coordinate their activity in such networks. For networks with finite in-degree, i.e., finite number of presynaptic inputs per neuron, we find a speed limit to coordinating spiking activity. Even with arbitrarily strong interaction strengths neurons cannot synchronize faster than at a certain maximal speed determined by the typical in-degree.},

  abstract = {A self-consistent rate equation model is presented to investigate the influence of carrier relaxation on the modulation response of 1.3 mum InAs-GaAs quantum dot lasers. In this model, the carrier dynamics in GaAs barrier, relaxation pathways, and the phonon- and Auger-assisted relaxation are considered. The dependence of 3 dB bandwidth on the relaxation time and relaxation pathway is discussed. It is shown that carrier relaxation via less energy level has better carrier confinement and higher 3 dB bandwidth. The improvement of bandwidth by tunnelling injection QD structure is investigated from the point of view of relaxation pathway. The different effects of tunnelling into ground state and excited state on the 3 dB bandwidth are analyzed. The enhanced carrier relaxation by p-type modulation doping and its effect on the bandwidth are investigated. It is found that there exists a tradeoff on the improvement of bandwidth by p-doping, which is explained as the competition between the bandwidth limitation of K -factor and relaxation dynamics. Increase in the bandwidth of QD lasers by improving both the carrier relaxation dynamics and K-factor limitation is discussed.},

  abstract = {We study the effect of lateral carrier diffusion on the transient turn-on of a semiconductor laser with optical feedback. The numerical simulations are based on the Lang-Kobayashi model, and on an extension of the model that includes lateral profiles for the carrier density and the optical field. For moderately strong feedback, intensity pulses characterize the dynamics of the turn-on, with a repetition rate at the external cavity round-trip time. We find that carrier diffusion has an important effect when the laser is biased close to the solitary threshold. For low carrier diffusion the intensity drops to a nearly zero value in between the pulses; for fast carrier diffusion, the spatial holes in the carrier profile burned by the intensity pulses are quickly replenished, and the intensity does not decay to a zero value in between the pulses. The results of our analysis show that the effect of diffusion is qualitatively well modelled by a non-linear gain saturation coefficient different from zero in the space-independent Lang-Kobayashi model.

  abstract = {Electrical coupling among inhibitory interneurons has been discovered in various regions of the brain. Since these local networks indicate a sophisticated activity by the interplay between electrical and inhibitory synapses, the emergence of synchronous phenomena have been investigated by many researchers. We propose coupled neuronal models connected by both inhibitory and electrical synapses and investigate the emergence of various synchronous phenomena and its bifurcational structures by bifurcation analysis. Although it is generally known that a strong gap junction synchronizes coupled neurons, we show in-phase and anti-phase phenomena in coupled neurons connected by both inhibitory and electrical synapses. They change to chaotic solutions via period-doubling and pitchfork bifurcations.},

  abstract = {With the aim of formulating a method to control dynamic phase transitions in periodically driven bistable systems with reversal symmetry, a time-delayed feedback control method to stabilize an unstable periodic orbit in the broken symmetric regime is studied. In order to overcome a limitation of the conventional time-delayed feedback method, another extended scheme is proposed, and its improved ability with respect to stabilization is proved. Through the linear stability analysis of model controlled systems driven by sinusoidal fields, basic differences between the conventional and proposed methods are extracted. It is clarified that a few characteristics around the bifurcation point from the pitchfork critical branch to the Hopf branch and the turning point of the Hopf critical branch classify essential features of the stability diagram and concern restrictions for stabilization. Within the linear stability treatment, this paper estimates a safe choice and an effective range of feedback gains in the proposed method.},

  abstract = {Waves of chemical or electrical activity, traveling through space, have been observed in several contexts: chemical reaction mixtures in non-convecting liquid phase, cell suspensions, nerve axons, and neuromuscular tissues. Typically, wave-supporting preparations are excitable; that is, they respond and sensitivity to perturbations are rapidly damped out, but suprathreshold disturbances trigger an abrupt and substantial response. The abruptness of the response can be exploited by the methods of singular perturbation theory to obtain a mathematical description of wave propagation in spatially distributed excitable media. Singular perturbation analysis of propagating waves in one spatial dimension is straightforward and uncontentious, but the analysis of propagating waves in one spatial dimension is straightforward and several fundamentally different ways. We compare and contrast the approaches taken by Greenberg, Zykov, Fife, Krinskii and his collaborators, and ourselves, with particular emphasis on the case of rotating spiral waves. Our intention is to bring some order to the important but difficult theory of propagating waves in two-dimensional excitable media. In conclusion we discuss briefly some possible extensions of the singular perturbation approach to propagating wave surfaces in three-dimensional space.},

We compute numerous features of the graph including the number of users and friendships, the degree distribution, path lengths, clustering, and mixing patterns. Our results center around three main observations. First, we characterize the global structure of the graph, determining that the social network is nearly fully connected, with 99.91\% of individuals belonging to a single large connected component, and we confirm the "six degrees of separation" phenomenon on a global scale. Second, by studying the average local clustering coefficient and degeneracy of graph neighborhoods, we show that while the Facebook graph as a whole is clearly sparse, the graph neighborhoods of users contain surprisingly dense structure. Third, we characterize the assortativity patterns present in the graph by studying the basic demographic and network properties of users. We observe clear degree assortativity and characterize the extent to which "your friends have more friends than you". Furthermore, we observe a strong effect of age on friendship preferences as well as a globally modular community structure driven by nationality, but we do not find any strong gender homophily. We compare our results with those from smaller social networks and find mostly, but not entirely, agreement on common structural network characteristics.}},

  abstract = {Following the discovery of context-dependent synchronization of oscillatory neuronal responses in the visual system, the role of neural synchrony in cortical networks has been expanded to provide a general mechanism for the coordination of distributed neural activity patterns. In the current paper, we present an update of the status of this hypothesis through summarizing recent results from our laboratory that suggest important new insights regarding the mechanisms, function and relevance of this phenomenon. In the first part, we present recent results derived from animal experiments and mathematical simulations that provide novel explanations and mechanisms for zero and nero-zero phase lag synchronization. In the second part, we shall discuss the role of neural synchrony for expectancy during perceptual organization and its role in conscious experience. This will be followed by evidence that indicates that in addition to supporting conscious cognition, neural synchrony is abnormal in major brain disorders, such as schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorders. We conclude this paper with suggestions for further research as well as with critical issues that need to be addressed in future studies.},

Individuals exert &#8216;&#8216;contagion effects&#8217;&#8217; on one another through social ties and association. These analyses have come under critique because of the possibility that homophily from unmeasured factors may explain these statistical associations and because similar findings can be obtained when the same methodology is applied to height, acne, and headaches, for which the conclusion of contagion effects seems somewhat less plausible. The author uses sensitivity analysis techniques to assess the extent to which supposed contagion effects for obesity, smoking, happiness, and loneliness might be explained away by homophily or confounding and the extent to which the critique using analysis of data on height, acne, and headaches is relevant. Sensitivity analyses suggest that contagion effects for obesity and smoking cessation are reasonably robust to possible latent homophily or environmental confounding; those for happiness and loneliness are somewhat less so. Supposed effects for height, acne, and headaches are all easily explained away by latent homophily and confounding. The methodology that has been used in past studies for contagion effects in social networks, when used in conjunction with sensitivity analysis, may prove useful in establishing social influence for various behaviors and states. The sensitivity analysis approach can be used to address the critique of latent homophily as a possible explanation of associations interpreted as contagion effects.},

One of those techniques, reservoir computing (RC), is a decade old and has achieved state-of-the-art performance for processing sequential data. Dedicated hardware realizations of RC could enable speed gains and power savings. Here we propose the first integrated passive silicon photonics reservoir. We demonstrate experimentally and through simulations that, thanks to the RC paradigm, this generic chip can be used to perform arbitrary Boolean logic operations with memory as well as 5-bit header recognition up to 12.5{\^a}��Gbit{\^a}��s{\^a}��1, without power consumption in the reservoir. It can also perform isolated spoken digit recognition. Our realization exploits optical phase for computing. It is scalable to larger networks and much higher bitrates, up to speeds >100{\^a}��Gbit{\^a}��s{\^a}��1. These results pave the way for the application of integrated photonic RC for a wide range of applications.},

In the present study, we are constructing and testing a mathematical model capable of simulating changes in brain energy metabolism that develop in real time under various pathophysiological conditions. The model incorporates the following parameters: cerebral blood flow, partial oxygen pressure, mitochondrial NADH redox state, and extracellular potassium. Accordingly, all the model variables are only time dependent (`point-model' approach). Numerical runs demonstrate the ability of the model to mimic pathological conditions, such as complete and partial ischemia, cortical spreading depression under normoxic and partial ischemic conditions. They also show that, when properly tuned, a model of this type permits the monitoring of only one or two crucial variables and the computation of the remaining variables in real time during clinical or experimental procedures.},

  abstract = {Schl{\"o}gl's model is the canonical example of a chemical reaction system that exhibits bistability. Because the biological examples of bistability and switching behaviour are increasingly numerous, this paper presents an integrated deterministic, stochastic and thermodynamic analysis of the model. After a brief review of the deterministic and stochastic modelling frameworks, the concepts of chemical and mathematical detailed balances are discussed and non-equilibrium conditions are shown to be necessary for bistability. Thermodynamic quantities such as the flux, chemical potential and entropy production rate are defined and compared across the two models. In the bistable region, the stochastic model exhibits an exchange of the global stability between the two stable states under changes in the pump parameters and volume size. The stochastic entropy production rate shows a sharp transition that mirrors this exchange. A new hybrid model that includes continuous diffusion and discrete jumps is suggested to deal with the multiscale dynamics of the bistable system. Accurate approximations of the exponentially small eigenvalue associated with the time scale of this switching and the full time-dependent solution are calculated using Matlab. A breakdown of previously known asymptotic approximations on small volume scales is observed through comparison with these and Monte Carlo results. Finally, in the appendix section is an illustration of how the diffusion approximation of the chemical master equation can fail to represent correctly the mesoscopically interesting steady-state behaviour of the system.},

  abstract = {We present a numerical exploration of contact transitions with the fingertip. When picking up objects our fingertips must make contact at specific locations, and&#8212;upon contact&#8212;maintain posture while pr oducing well-directed force vectors. However, the joint torques for moving the fingertip towards a surface () are different from those for producing static force vectors (). We previously described the neural con trol of such abrupt transitions in humans, and found that unavoidable errors arise because sensorimotor time delays and lags prevent an instantaneous switch between different torques. Here, we use numerical optim ization on a finger model to reveal physical bounds for controlling such rapid contact transitions. Resembling human data, it is necessary to anticipatorily switch joint torques to at about 30 ms before contact to minimize the initial misdirection of the fingertip force vector. This anticipatory strategy arises in our deterministic model from neuromuscular lags, and not from optimizing for robustness to noise/uncertaint ies. Importantly, the optimal solution also leads to a trade-off between the speed of force magnitude increase versus the accuracy of initial force direction. This is an alternative to prevailing theories that pr opose multiplicative noise in muscles as the driver of speed&#8211;accuracy trade-offs. We instead find that the speed&#8211;accuracy trade-off arises solely from neuromuscular lags. Finally, because our model intentionally uses idealized assumptions, its agreement with human data suggests that the biological system is controlled in a way that approaches the physical boundaries of performance.},

  abstract = {Fifty years after the invention of the laser diode, and forty years after the butterfly effect signified the unpredictability of deterministic chaos, it is commonly believed that a laser diode behaves like a damped nonlinear oscillator and cannot be driven into chaotic operation without additional forcing or parameter modulation. Here, we counter that belief and report the first example of a free-running laser diode generating chaos. The underlying physics comprises a nonlinear coupling between two elliptically polarized modes in a vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser. We identify chaos in experimental time series and show, theoretically, the bifurcations leading to single- and double-scroll attractors with characteristics similar to Lorenz chaos. The reported polarization chaos resembles noise-driven mode hopping, but shows opposite statistical properties. Our findings open up new research areas for the creation of controllable and integrated sources of optical chaos.},

Such a balance could be established and maintained in an experience-dependent manner by synaptic plasticity at inhibitory synapses. We show that this mechanism provides an explanation for the sparse firing patterns observed in response to natural stimuli and fits well with a recently observed interaction of excitatory and inhibitory receptive field plasticity. The introduction of inhibitory plasticity in suitable recurrent networks provides a homeostatic mechanism that leads to asynchronous irregular network states. Further, it can accommodate synaptic memories with activity patterns that become indiscernible from the background state but can be reactivated by external stimuli. Our results suggest an essential role of inhibitory plasticity in the formation and maintenance of functional cortical circuitry.},

This power represents over two orders of magnitude improvement over previous III-V static memory cells.

After an over-view of semiconductor random access memory architecture and technology, the concept of tunneling-based SRAM (TSRAM) is introduced. Experimental results for a compound semiconductor 1-bit 50-nW TSRAM gain cell using low current density (similar to 1 A/cm(2)) RTD's and low-leakage heterostructure field effect transistors al-e presented. We describe a one-transistor TSRAM cell which could convert silicon dynamic RAM (DRAM) to ultradense SRAM if an ultralow current density (similar to 1 mu A/cm(2)) silicon bistable device is developed. Finally, we present experimental and simulation results Sol a TSRAM cell using multipeaked I-V curve devices and a multivalued word line. This approach aims at increasing stola,ae density through vertical integration of bistable devices such as RTD's.}},

A global feedback is added in which a signal proportional to the difference between the sum of the currents of all elements and a mean current is fed back to the applied potential. The addition of global feedback transforms a system of weakly coupled elements to one of complete synchronization. At intermediate feedback strengths, intermittent, unstable chaotic clusters are observed in which clusters of elements form and break up. Stable clusters or condensates form at somewhat higher feedback strengths. The stable clusters become periodic at higher gain; both two-cluster and three-cluster states are observed. With a further increase in the feedback gain, one of the clusters dominates the collective dynamics; its size increases until at some feedback strength the entire system is synchronized. Delay in the feedback signal also influences the interaction of the oscillators.},

In general, groups of similar components are not necessarily identical with the communities in a community network; thus partitioning a network into groups of similar components provides additional information of the network structure. The proposed algorithm can also be used for community detection when the groups and the communities overlap. By introducing a tunable parameter that controls the involved effects of the heterogeneity, we can also investigate conveniently how the group structure can be coupled with the heterogeneity characteristics. In particular, an interesting example shows a group partition can evolve into a community partition in some situations when the involved heterogeneity effects are tuned. The extension of this algorithm to weighted networks is discussed as well.},

Detailed investigations reveal, however, that for longer delay lengths the synchrony of excitations in the network can again be enhanced due to the emergence of in-phase synchronization. In addition, we show that an appropriate small-world topology can restore synchronized behavior provided information transmission delays are either short or long. On the other hand, within the intermediate delay region, which is characterized by anti-phase synchronization and clustering, differences in the network topology do not notably affect the synchrony of neuronal activity.},

At the same time, synchronization of the coupled neurons is studied in terms of their mean frequencies. We also find that the small time delay can induce new period windows with the coupling strength increasing. Moreover, it is found that synchronization of the coupled neurons can be achieved in some parameter ranges and related to their bifurcation transition. Bifurcation diagrams are obtained numerically or analytically from the mathematical model and the parameter regions of different behavior are clarified.},

These results explain the lack of a major mobile virus breakout so far and predict that once a mobile operating system&#8217;s market share reaches the phase transition point, viruses will pose a serious threat to mobile communications.},

For gap-junctionally coupled networks we show that short delays can induce zigzag fronts of excitations, whereas long delays can further detriment synchronization due to a dynamic clustering anti-phase synchronization transition. For the synaptically coupled networks, on the other hand, we find that the clustering anti-phase synchronization can appear as a direct consequence of the prolongation of information transmission delay, without being accompanied by zigzag excitatory fronts. Irrespective of the coupling type, however, we show that an appropriate small-world topology can always restore synchronized activity if only the information transmission delays are short or moderate at most. Long information transmission delays always evoke anti-phase synchronization and clustering, in which case the fine-tuning of the network topology fails to restore the synchronization of neuronal activity.},

Strikingly, nonlinear dynamics can signi&#64257;cantly enhance the network controllability as compared with linear
 
dynamics. Interestingly, for one-dimensional nonlinear nodal dynamics, any bidirectional network system can
 
be fully controlled by a single driver node, regardless of the network topology. Our results imply that real-world
 
networks may be more controllable than predicted for linear network systems, due to the ubiquity of nonlinear
 
dynamics in nature.

In the absence of information transmission delay the bursting activity is desynchronized, giving rise to spatiotemporally disordered dynamics. This paper shows that the introduction of finite delays can lead to the synchronization of bursting and thus to the emergence of coherent propagating fronts of excitation in the space-time domain. Moreover, it shows that the type of synchronous bursting is uniquely determined by the delay length, with the transitions from one type to the other occurring in a step-like manner depending on the delay. Interestingly, as the delay is tuned close to the transition points, the synchronization deteriorates, which implies the coexistence of different bursting attractors. These phenomena can be observed by different but fixed coupling strengths, thus indicating a new role for information transmission delays in realistic neuronal networks.},

  abstract = {The skin patterns of animals are very important for their survival, yet the mechanisms involved in skin pattern formation remain unresolved. Turing's reaction-diffusion model presents a well-known mathematical explanation of how animal skin patterns are formed, and this model can predict various animal patterns that are observed in nature. In this study, we used transgenic zebrafish to generate various artificial skin patterns including a narrow stripe with a wide interstripe, a narrow stripe with a narrow interstripe, a labyrinth, and a 'leopard' pattern (or donut-like ring pattern). In this process, connexin41.8 (or its mutant form) was ectopically expressed using the mitfa promoter. Specifically, the leopard pattern was generated as predicted by Turing's model. Our results demonstrate that the pigment cells in animal skin have the potential and plasticity to establish various patterns and that the reaction-diffusion principle can predict skin patterns of animals.

  abstract = {Detailed experimental and numerical results are presented about the pattern formation mechanism of spatially organized partially synchronized states in a networked chemical system with oscillatory metal dissolution. Numerical simulations of the reaction system are used to identify experimental conditions (heterogeneity{,} network topology{,} and coupling time-scale) under which the chemical reactions{,} that take place on a network{,} split into coexisting coherent and incoherent domains through the chimera mechanism. Experiments are carried out with a network of twenty electrodes arranged in a ring with seven nearest neighbor couplings in both directions along the ring. The patterns are characterized by analyzing the oscillation frequencies and entrainments to the mean field of the phases of oscillations. The chimera state forms from two domains of elements: the chimera core in which the elements have identical frequencies and are entrained to their corresponding mean field{,} and the chimera shell where the elements exhibit desynchrony with each other and mean field. The experiments point out the importance of low level of heterogeneities (e.g.{,} surface conditions) and optimal level of coupling strength and time-scale as necessary components for the realization of the chimera state. For systems with large heterogeneities{,} a {'}remnant{'} chimera state is identified where the pattern is strongly affected by the presence of frequency clusters. The exploration of dynamical features with networked reactions could open ways for identification of novel types of patterns that cannot be observed with reaction diffusion systems (with localized interactions) or with reactions under global constraints{,} coupling{,} or feedback.},

Using new pump-power dependent photon-correlation measurements, we demonstrate that this seemingly contradictory observation that has so far defied an explanation stems from cascaded cavity photon emission in transitions between excited multiexciton states. The mesoscopic nature of quantum-dot confinement ensures the presence of a quasicontinuum of excitonic transitions, part of which overlaps with the cavity resonance.}},

  abstract = {Robust synchronization is essential to ensure the stable operation of many complex networked systems such as electric power grids. Increasing energy demands and more strongly distributing power sources raise the question of where to add new connection lines to the already existing grid. Here we study how the addition of individual links impacts the emergence of synchrony in oscillator networks that model power grids on coarse scales. We reveal that adding new links may not only promote but also destroy synchrony and link this counter-intuitive phenomenon to Braess's paradox known for traffic networks. We analytically uncover its underlying mechanism in an elementary grid example, trace its origin to geometric frustration in phase oscillators, and show that it generically occurs across a wide range of systems. As an important consequence, upgrading the grid requires particular care when adding new connections because some may destabilize the synchronization of the grid&#8212;and thus induce power outages.},

Our main focus is the emergence of stable solutions with a single differentiated node in systems with large and possibly irregular network topology. Based on a mean-field approach, we study the bifurcations of such solutions for varying system parameters and varying degree of the differentiated node. Such solutions appear typically before the onset of Turing instability and provide the basis for the complex scenario of multistability and hysteresis that can be observed in such systems. Moreover, we discuss the appearance of stable collective patterns and present a codimension-two bifurcation that organizes the interplay between collective patterns and patterns with single differentiated nodes.}},

Several criteria for global synchronization are provided which generalize some previous results. The Jordan canonical transformation method is used in stead of the matrix diagonalization method. Especially, we show clearly that, the synchronizability of a dynamical network with nonsymmetric coupling is not always characterized by its second-largest eigenvalue, even though all the eigenvalues of the nonsymmetric coupling matrix are real. Furthermore, the effects of the asymmetry of coupling on synchronizability of networks with different structures are analyzed. Numerical simulations are also done to illustrate and verify the theoretical results on networks in which each node is a dynamical limit cycle oscillator consisting of a two-cell cellular neural network.},

Here we present clear empirical evidence from Short Message correspondence that observed human actions are the result of the interplay of three basic ingredients: Poisson initiation of tasks and decision making for task execution in individual humans as well as interaction among individuals. This interplay leads to new types of interevent time distribution, neither completely Poisson nor power-law, but a bimodal combination of them. We show that the events can be separated into independent bursts which are generated by frequent mutual interactions in short times following random initiations of communications in longer times by the individuals. We introduce a minimal model of two interacting priority queues incorporating the three basic ingredients which fits well the distributions using the parameters extracted from the empirical data. The model can also embrace a range of realistic social interacting systems such as e-mail and letter communications when taking the time scale of processing into account. Our findings provide insight into various human activities both at the individual and network level. Our analysis and modeling of bimodal activity in human communication from the viewpoint of the interplay between processes of different time scales is likely to shed light on bimodal phenomena in other complex systems, such as interevent times in earthquakes, rainfall, forest fire, and economic systems, etc.},

  abstract = {Thalamic neurons, which play important roles in the genesis of rhythmic activities of the brain, show various bursting behaviors, particularly modulated by complex thalamocortical feedback via cortical neurons. As a first step to explore this complex neural system and focus on the effects of the feedback on the bursting behavior, a simple loop structure delayed in time and scaled by a coupling strength is added to a recent mean-field model of bursting neurons. Depending on the coupling strength and delay time, the modeled neurons show two distinct response patterns: one entrained to the unperturbed bursting frequency of the neurons and one entrained to the resonant frequency of the loop structure. Transitions between these two patterns are explored in the model&#8217;s parameter space via extensive numerical simulations. It is found that at a fixed loop delay, there is a critical coupling strength at which the dominant response frequency switches from the unperturbed bursting frequency to the loopinduced one. Furthermore, alternating occurrence of these two response frequencies is observed when the delay varies at fixed coupling strength. The results demonstrate that bursting is coupled with feedback to yield new dynamics, which will provide insights into such effects in more complex neural systems.},

Interaction and competition between these symmetry-breaking modes lead to the emergence of a large variety of spatiotemporal patterns, including modulated Turing structures, modulated standing waves, and combinations of Turing structures and spiral waves. Spatial resonances are obtained near codimension-two Turing-wave bifurcations. Far from bifurcation lines, we obtain inwardly propagating spiral waves with Turing spots at their tips. We demonstrate that the coexistence of Turing spots and traveling waves is a result of interaction between Turing and oscillatory modes, while the inwardly propagating waves (antispirals) do not require this interaction; they can arise from the wave instability combined with a negative group velocity.},

  abstract = {Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in developed countries. The pathological process of the heart is associated with an altered expression profile of genes that are important for cardiac function. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have recently emerged as one of the central players of gene expression regulation. The implications of miRNAs in the pathological process of the cardiovascular system have recently been recognized, and research on miRNAs in relation to cardiovascular disease has now become a most rapidly evolving field. In this review, we focus on miRNAs and control of cardiac excitability, aiming to provide a comprehensive overview on the available experimental data on regulation of cardiac conduction, repolarization, and automaticity by miRNAs. Aberrant expression of miRNAs in the diseased state of the heart and their arrhythmogenic or anti-arrhythmic potential will be discussed. Finally, the innovative miRNA-interference technologies developed lately for manipulating the action of miRNAs by interfering with their expression, stability, and function as new approaches for miRNA research and gene therapy will be introduced.},

  abstract = {Ongoing interactions among cortical neurons often manifest as network-level synchrony. Understanding the spatiotemporal dynamics of such spontaneous synchrony is important because it may (1) influence network response to input, (2) shape activity-dependent microcircuit structure, and (3) reveal fundamental network properties, such as an imbalance of excitation (E) and inhibition (I). Here we delineate the spatiotemporal character of spontaneous synchrony in rat cortex slice cultures and a computational model over a range of different E&#8211;I conditions including disfacilitated (antagonized AMPA, NMDA receptors), unperturbed, and disinhibited (antagonized GABAA receptors). Local field potential was recorded with multielectrode arrays during spontaneous burst activity. Synchrony among neuronal groups was quantified based on phase-locking among recording sites. As network excitability was increased from low to high, we discovered three phenomena at an intermediate excitability level: (1) onset of synchrony, (2) maximized variability of synchrony, and (3) neuronal avalanches. Our computational model predicted that these three features occur when the network operates near a unique balanced E&#8211;I condition called &#8220;criticality.&#8221; These results were invariant to changes in the measurement spatial extent, spatial resolution, and frequency bands. Our findings indicate that moderate average synchrony, which is required to avoid pathology, occurs over a limited range of E&#8211;I conditions and emerges together with maximally variable synchrony. If variable synchrony is detrimental to cortical function, this is a cost paid for moderate average synchrony. However, if variable synchrony is beneficial, then by operating near criticality the cortex may doubly benefit from moderate mean and maximized variability of synchrony.},

The band-structure details are included in these Maxwell-Bloch equations through two parameters &#954; and &#950; which can be determined numerically by using their definitions or obtained experimentally by fitting the measured data. In the limit of ultrafast intraband relaxation (the rate-equation approximation), these equations reduce to the conventional rate equations. As an illustration of the usefulness of the new Maxwell-Bloch equations we have obtained the analytic expressions for several important laser parameters such as the differential gain, the linewidth enhancement factor and the nonlinear gain coefficient, in terms of the parameters &#954; and &#950; when the semiconductor laser is operating continuously (the cw operation). The results obtained from these analytic expressions agree with those obtained numerically from the density-matrix equations under steady-state conditions by integrating over the density of states.},

networks of conductance-based integrateand-
 
fire (IF) neurons with balanced excitatory and
 
inhibitory connections and with finite axonal propagation
 
speed. We focused on the genesis of states with
 
highly irregular spiking activity and synchronous firing
 
patterns at low rates, called slow Synchronous Irregular
 
(SI) states. In such balanced networks, we examined
 
the {\^a}��macroscopic{\^a}�� properties of the spiking activity,
 
such as ensemble correlations and mean firing rates,
 
for different intracortical connectivity profiles ranging
 
from randomly connected networks to networks with
 
Gaussian-distributed local connectivity. We systematically
 
computed the distance-dependent correlations at
 
the extracellular (spiking) and intracellular (membrane
 
potential) levels between randomly assigned pairs of
 
neurons. The main finding is that such properties, when
 
they are averaged at a macroscopic scale, are invariant
 
with respect to the different connectivity patterns, provided the excitatory-inhibitory balance is the same.
 
In particular, the same correlation structure holds for
 
different connectivity profiles. In addition, we examined
 
the response of such networks to external input,
 
and found that the correlation landscape can be modulated
 
by the mean level of synchrony imposed by
 
the external drive. This modulation was found again
 
to be independent of the external connectivity profile.
 
We conclude that first and second-order {\^a}��mean-field{\^a}��
 
statistics of such networks do not depend on the details
 
of the connectivity at a microscopic scale. This study is
 
an encouraging step toward a mean-field description of
 
topological neuronal networks.},

flow corresponds to coexisting family that emerges nonlinearly from a distinct oscillatory Hopf instability.
 
Consequently, the resulting pattern selection is qualitatively different from the symmetric finite wavenumber

  abstract = {Formation of stationary periodic patterns is paramount to many
 
chemical, biological, physical, and ecological media. One of the
 
most subtle mechanisms was suggested by Turing, who
 
highlighted the applicability of isotropic reaction-diffusion
 
dynamics with at least two diffusing fields. However, on finite
 
domains with the presence of a symmetry breaking differential
 
advection, two diffusing fields are rather disadvantageous to
 
formation of stationary periodic patterns. We show that the
 
criterion to stationary periodic patterns in Turing type models
 
requires non-periodic boundary conditions and tuning of two
 
parameters (a co-dimension-2 bifurcation in space) whereas in
 
systems with one diffusing field (non-Turing) the bifurcation is of
 
co-dimension 1 and thus easier to satisfy. We demonstrate this
 
general result using spatial dynamics methods and direct numerical
 
simulations of the canonical FitzHugh-Nagumo model.},

In the present paper, we propose a new analysis method for phenomena on networks based on a categorization of nodes. First, local statistics such as the average path length and the clustering coefficient for a node are calculated and assigned to the respective node. Then, the nodes are categorized using the self-organizing map algorithm. Characteristic properties of the phenomena of interest are visualized for each category of nodes. The validity of our method is demonstrated using the results of two simulation models. The proposed method is useful as a research tool to understand the behavior of networks, in particular, for the large-scale networks for which existing visualization techniques cannot work well.},

It is of importance to understand the implications of such complex network structures in the functional organization of the brain activities. Here we study this problem from the viewpoint of dynamical complex networks. We investigate synchronization dynamics on the corticocortical network of the cat by modeling each node (cortical area) of the network with a sub-network of interacting excitable neurons. We find that the network displays clustered synchronization behavior, and the dynamical clusters coincide with the topological community structures observed in the anatomical network. Our results provide insights into the relationship between the global organization and the functional specialization of the brain cortex.},

The coarse-grained networks are required to preserve statistical properties as well as the dynamic behaviors of the initial networks. Some methods have been proposed and found effective in undirected networks,while the study on coarse-graining directed networks lacks of consideration. In this paper we proposed a path-based coarse-graining (PCG) method to coarse grain the directed networks. Performing the linear stability analysis of synchronization and numerical simulation of the Kuramoto model on four kinds of directed networks, including tree networks and variants of Barab�asi-Albert networks, Watts-Strogatz networks, and Erd�os-R�enyi networks, we find our method can effectively preserve the network synchronizability.},

We show that the REBG method improves the residual degree gradient (RDG) method by effectively avoiding the synchronization failure. Further experiments show that the REBG method enhances the synchronizability in networks with a community structure compared with the RDG method.},

The experiments are done with an array of nickel electrodes undergoing electrodissolution in sulfuric acid. The experiments verify theories of Winfree and Kuramoto that predict that global coupling of a set of smooth limit cycle oscillators with different frequencies produces a phase transition in which some of the elements synchronize. Both the critical point and the predicted dependence of order on coupling are seen in the experiments. We extend the studies to relaxation oscillators and characterize the quantitative similarities and differences between the two types of systems. Numerical simulations using a coupled form of a nickel electrodissolution model support the experimental findings.},

The experimental results provide laboratory evidence for the findings in the studies of delayed feedback on phase oscillators; multiple, isolated regions of desynchronization in the parameter plane, hysteresis phenomenon around the boundaries of control regions, synchronization of irregular behavior with very strong feedback strength, and a shift of the synchronization transition curves were reproduced in experiments. In addition, it is observed that clustering accompanies the occurrence of desynchronization in delayed feedback of relaxational oscillators. For populations of elements that are close to Hopf bifurcation, desynchronization, amplitude death, and enhanced synchronization occurs with a low, intermediate, and high delay time, respectively.},

Our results provide a possibility for the control of synchronization in complex networks by the manipulation of a few parameters.},

  abstract = {This paper investigates synchronization dynamics of a general model of complex delayed networks as well as the effects of time delays. Some simple yet generic criteria ensuring delay-independent and delay-dependent synchronization are derived, which are less conservative than those reported so far in the literature. Moreover, a scale "&#957;" denoted by a function of the smallest and the second largest eigenvalues of coupling matrix is presented to analyze the effects of time delays on synchronization of the networks. Furthermore, various kinds of coupling schemes, including small-world networks and scale-free networks, are studied. It is shown that, if the coupling delays are less than a positive threshold, then the network will be synchronized. On the other hand, with the increase of the coupling delays, the synchronizability of the network will be restrained and even eventually desynchronized. The results are illustrated by a prototype composed of the chaotic Duffing oscillators. Numerical simulations are also given to verify theoretical results.},

Upon increasing the coupling strength, a transition from regular to stochasticlike regime is observed. In the weak-coupling phase, a periodic dynamics is rapidly approached, with all neurons firing with the same rate and mutually phase locked. The strong-coupling phase is characterized by an irregular pattern, even though the maximum Lyapunov exponent is negative. The paradox is solved by drawing an analogy with the phenomenon of "stable chaos," i.e., by observing that the stochasticlike behavior is "limited" to an exponentially long (with the system size) transient. Remarkably, the transient dynamics turns out to be stationary.},

This is done by reducing the set of differential equations to a map that is investigated in the limit of large network size. We show that the stability of the splay state depends crucially on the ratio between the pulse width and the interspike interval. More precisely, the spectrum of Floquet exponents turns out to consist of three components: (i) one that coincides with the predictions of the mean-field analysis [Abbott and van Vreesvijk, Phys. Rev. E 48, 1483 (1993)], (ii) a component measuring the instability of &#8220;finite-frequency&#8221; modes, (iii) a number of &#8220;isolated&#8221; eigenvalues that are connected to the characteristics of the single pulse and may give rise to strong instabilities (the Floquet exponent being proportional to the network size). Finally, as a side result, we find that the splay state can be stable even for inhibitory coupling.},

Correlation analyses of the GI with age, body weight, body length, brain weight and volume of the prosencephalon and the cortex show no significant results. GI values do not differ significantly between male and female brains, right and left hemispheres or right and left sides of the superior temporal plane. The GI shows maximal values over the prefrontal and the parieto-temporo-occipital association cortex. A comparison between the rostro-caudal GI patterns of human brains and those of prosimians and Old World monkeys shows the largest difference over the prefrontal cortex. The mean GI increases from prosimians to human brains with the highest values for non-human primates being in the pongid group.},
